# Electronic density of states as the descriptor of elastic bond strength, ductility, and local lattice distortion in BCC refractory alloys

## 电子状态密度作为BCC耐火合金中弹性粘结强度，延展性和局部晶格畸变的描述符

Abstract: Although electronic density of states (DOS) is fundamental to materials properties, its general relationship to mechanical properties of alloys is not well established. In this paper, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that the electronic occupancy at the Fermi level, N(Ef), obtained from DOS is a key descriptor of alloy strength and ductility. Our comprehensive analysis of numerous body centered cubic (BCC) refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) shows an overwhelming correlation that low N(Ef) indicates strong bonds that have high stiffness resulting in high elastic constants. High bond stiffness indicates presence of covalent nature of bonds that are directional in nature resulting in resistance to deformation leading to high bulk (B) and shear (G) moduli. Consequently, N(Ef) provides a direct correlation to the tendency of alloy ductility evidenced in the Pugh ratio (G/B). As stiffer bonds result in lower local lattice distortion (LLD), N(Ef) are LLD are also found to be corelated which opens up a correlation to solid solution strengthening and yield strength. Thus, this work unveils fundamental correlations between N(Ef) and (1) elastic bond strength, (2) ductility, and (3) LLD. These correlations open opportunities for the design of high strength high ductile RHEAs.

# Manifestations of the possible thermodynamic origin of water's anomalies in non-classical vapor nucleation at negative pressures

Abstract: Over the years, various scenarios -- such as the stability-limit conjecture (SLC), two critical point (TCP), critical point-free (CPF), and singularity-free (SF) -- have been proposed to explain the thermodynamic origin of supercooled waters anomalies. However, direct experimental validation is challenging due to the rapid phase transition from metastable water. In this study, we explored whether the phase transition pathways from metastable water provide insight into the thermodynamic origin of these anomalies. Using a classical density functional theory approach with realistic theoretical water models, we examined how different thermodynamic scenarios influence vapor nucleation kinetics at negative pressures. Our findings show significant variations in nucleation kinetics and mechanism during both isobaric and isochoric cooling. In the TCP scenario, the nucleation barrier increases steadily during isobaric cooling, with a slight decrease near the Widom line at lower temperatures (Ts). In contrast, the SF scenario shows a monotonic increase in the nucleation barrier. For the CPF scenario, we observed a non-classical mechanism, such as wetting-mediated nucleation (where the growing vapor nucleus is wetted by the intermediate low-density liquid phase) and the Ostwald step rule at low temperatures. Isochoric cooling pathways also revealed notable differences in T-dependent nucleation barrier trends between the TCP and CPF scenarios. Overall, this study underscores the importance of analyzing phase transition kinetics and mechanism to understand the precise thermodynamic origin of supercooled waters anomalies.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an exact formula for the phonon linewidths involving only dressed electron-phonon couplings and ensuring the positivity property. The formula is designed to account for both nonadiabatic and correlation effects, and it provides an alternative proof that Density Functional Perturbation Theory calculations of phonon linewidths are not affected by a double counting of screening diagrams. Furthermore, we extend the treatment to nonequilibrium scenarios and offer a rigorous justification for employing the phononic Boltzmann equation.

# Towards Nanoscale and Element-Specific Lattice Temperature Measurements using Core-Loss Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy

Abstract: Measuring nanoscale local temperatures, particularly in vertically integrated and multi-component systems, remains challenging. Spectroscopic techniques like X-ray absorption and core-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) are sensitive to lattice temperature, but understanding thermal effects is nontrivial. This work explores the potential for nanoscale and element-specific core-loss thermometry by comparing the Si L2,3 edge's temperature-dependent redshift against plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET) in a scanning TEM. Using density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we ab initio model both the Si L2,3 and plasmon redshift. We find that the core-loss redshift is due to bandgap reduction from electron-phonon renormalization. Our results indicate that despite lower core-loss signal intensity and thus accuracy compared to PEET, core-loss thermometry still has important advantages. Specifically, we show that the Varshni equation easily interprets the core-loss redshift, which avoids plasmon spectral convolution for PEET in complex materials. We also find that core-loss thermometry is more accurate than PEET at modeling thermal lattice expansion unless the temperature-dependent effective mass and dielectric constant are known. Furthermore, core-loss thermometry has the potential to measure nanoscale heating in multi-component materials and stacked interfaces with elemental specificity at length scales smaller than the plasmon's wavefunction.

# Diagonalization without Diagonalization: A Direct Optimization Approach for Solid-State Density Functional Theory

## 无对角化的对角化: 固态密度泛函理论的直接优化方法

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05033

arXiv:2411.05033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to address the challenges of variable occupation numbers in direct optimization of density functional theory (DFT). By parameterizing both the eigenfunctions and the occupation matrix, our method minimizes the free energy with respect to these parameters. As the stationary conditions require the occupation matrix and the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian to be simultaneously diagonalizable, this leads to the concept of ``self-diagonalization,'' where, by assuming a diagonal occupation matrix without loss of generality, the Hamiltonian matrix naturally becomes diagonal at stationary points. Our method incorporates physical constraints on both the eigenfunctions and the occupations into the parameterization, transforming the constrained optimization into an fully differentiable unconstrained problem, which is solvable via gradient descent. Implemented in JAX, our method was tested on aluminum and silicon, confirming that it achieves efficient self-diagonalization, produces the correct Fermi-Dirac distribution of the occupation numbers and yields band structures consistent with those obtained with SCF methods in Quantum Espresso.

# Multidimensional quantum dynamics with explicitly correlated Gaussian wave packets using Rothe's method

## 使用Rothe方法具有明确相关的高斯波包的多维量子动力学

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05459

arXiv:2411.05459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous publication [J. Chem. Phys., 161, 044105 (2024)], it has been shown that Rothe's method can be used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) for the hydrogen atom in a strong laser field using time-dependent Gaussian wave packets. Here, we generalize these results, showing that Rothe's method can propagate arbitrary numbers of thawed, complex-valued, explicitly correlated Gaussian functions (ECGs) with dense correlation matrices for systems with varying dimensionality. We consider the multidimensional Henon-Heiles potential, and show that the dynamics can be quantitatively reproduced using only 30 Gaussians in 2D, and that accurate spectra can be obtained using 20 Gaussians in 2D and 30 to 40 Gaussians in 3D and 4D. Thus, the relevant multidimensional dynamics can be described at high quality using only a small number of ECGs that give a very compact representation of the wave function. This efficient representation, along with the demonstrated ability of Rothe's method to propagate Gaussian wave packets in strong fields and ECGs in complex potentials, paves the way for accurate molecular dynamics calculations beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in strong fields.

# Minimum Energy Conical Intersection
Optimization Using DFT/MRCI(2)

## 最小能量圆锥相交
使用DFT/MRCI进行优化 (2)

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-3h77f-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

The combined density functional theory and multi-reference configuration interaction (DFT/MRCI) method is a semi-empirical electronic structure approach that is both computationally efficient and of predictive accuracy for the calculation of electronic excited states and simulation of electronic spectroscopies. However, given that the reference space is generated via a selected-CI procedure, a challenge arises in the construction of smooth potential energy surfaces. To address this issue, we treat the local discontinuities that arise as noise within the Gaussian progress regression framework and learn the surfaces by explicitly incorporating and optimizing a whitenoise kernel. The characteristic polynomial coefficient surfaces of the potential matrix, which are smooth functions of nuclear coordinates even at conical intersections, are learned in place of the adiabatic energies and are used to optimize the DFT/MRCI(2) minimum energy conical intersection geometries for representative intersection motifs in the molecules ethylene, butadiene, and fulvene. One consequence of explicitly treating the noise in the surfaces is that the energy difference cannot be made arbitrarily small at points of nominal intersection. Despite the limitations, however, we find the structures as well as the branching spaces to compare well with \textit{ab initio} MRCI and conclude that this approach is a viable method to learn a smooth representation of DFT/MRCI(2) surfaces.

Molecular assemblies are commonly found in biological systems; designing and reporting on synthetic mimics of these is a challenge for modern chemistry. Here, we apply ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), density functional theory calculations and mass-selective electrospray ion beam deposition followed by low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) to decipher the self-assembly, rearrangement and disassembly processes of {Cr6}n horseshoe oligomers (n = 1 - 5). Activated tandem IM-MS reveals the oligomer disassembly in detail, highlighting the stability of the dimer unit. When n = 2 and 3 oligomers are deposited on surfaces, we observe the rearrangement of dimers and trimers to dimers of dimers, as characterised by low temperature STM. In its entirety, the experimental and computational data provide a convincing framework for the analysis of supramolecular assembly processes in non-crystalline phases that could be used in future design strategies
