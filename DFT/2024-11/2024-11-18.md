# Role of momentum in the generator-coordinate method applied to barrier penetration

Author(s): K. Hagino and G. F. Bertsch<br /><p>This manuscript introduces a fresh theory perspective on nuclear fission. The typical approach to fission uses collective coordinates with, e.g., the potential energy derived from semiclassical microscopic-macroscopic models or from density functional theories. The novel approach is based on the configuration-interaction framework, which has been successful for calculating energies and spectroscopic properties, along with the generator-coordinate method introduced by Hill and Wheeler. Here the total wavefunction is represented by a superposition of Slater determinants characterized by the collective coordinate along the fission path. As an important new step, configurations with finite momenta are taken into account. With Kohn’s reaction theory to treat barrier penetration assuming a Gaussian-shaped barrier, the authors show that including the finite momentum configurations leads to a more stable and more accurate solution. This method, while applied to fission here, could be useful for other systems involving interacting fermions.</p><img height="" src="http://cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRC/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevC.110.054610.png" width="200" /><br />[Phys.

# Assessing the possible superconductivity in doped perovskite hydride KMgH$_3$: Effects of lattice anharmonicity and spin fluctuations

## 评估掺杂钙钛矿氢化物KMgH $_3 $ 中可能的超导性: 晶格非谐性和自旋波动的影响

Abstract: The superconducting properties of uniformly hole-doped perovskite hydride KMgH$_3$ with varying doping concentration and lattice parameter corresponding to different pressures were investigated from first principles. The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) was predicted from the density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT), where the effects of lattice anharmonicity and spin-fluctuation were considered and examined. Although lattice anharmonicity tends to suppress superconductivity around the edge of dynamical stability, where the phase is stabilized due to anharmonic effects, $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ is enhanced. In the hole-doped \ce{KMgH3}, substantial spin-fluctuation (SF) effects were discovered, which counters the phonon-mediated pairing and decreases $T_{\mathrm{c}}$. Such anomalously strong SF is evaluated for similar hydrides, where the hydrogen 1-$s$ bands are isolated at the Fermi level, and its correlation with the electronics density of states was explored.

# Enhanced heat dissipation and lowered power consumption in electronics using two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride coatings

## 使用二维六方氮化硼涂层增强电子器件的散热和降低功耗

arXiv:2411.10030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniaturization of electronic components has led to overheating, increasing power consumption and causing early circuit failures. Conventional heat dissipation methods are becoming inadequate due to limited surface area and higher short-circuit risks. This study presents a fast, low-cost, and scalable technique using 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) coatings to enhance heat dissipation in commercial electronics. Inexpensive hBN layers, applied by drop casting or spray coating, boost thermal conductivity at IC surfaces from below 0.3 W/m-K to 260 W/m-K, resulting in over double the heat flux and convective heat transfer. This significantly reduces operating temperatures and power consumption, as demonstrated by a 17.4% reduction in a coated audio amplifier circuit board. Density functional theory indicates enhanced interaction between 2D hBN and packaging materials as a key factor. This approach promises substantial energy and cost savings for large-scale electronics without altering existing manufacturing processes.

# Effect of Strain on the Band Gap of Monolayer MoS$_2$

## 应变对单层MoS $_2 $ 带隙的影响

Abstract: Monolayer molybdenum disulfide ($\mathrm{MoS_2}$) under strain has many interesting properties and possible applications in technology. A recent experimental study examined the effect of strain on the bandgap of monolayer $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ on a mildly curved graphite surface, reporting that under biaxial strain with a Poisson's ratio of 0.44, the bandgap decreases at a rate of 400 meV/\% strain. In this work, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a free-standing $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ monolayer, using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) PBE, the hybrid functional HSE06, and many-body perturbation theory with the GW approximation using PBE wavefunctions (G0W0@PBE). For the unstrained monolayer, we found a standard level of agreement for the bandgap between theory and experiment. For biaxial strain at the experimental Poisson's ratio, we found that the bandgap decreases at rates of 63 meV/\% strain (PBE), 73 meV/\% strain (HSE06), and 43 meV/\% strain (G0W0@PBE), which are significantly smaller than the experimental rate. We also found that PBE predicts a similarly smaller rate (90 meV/\% strain) for a different Poisson's ratio of 0.25. Spin-orbit correction (SOC) has little effect on the gap or its strain dependence. The strong disagreement between theory and experiment may reflect an unexpectedly strong effect of the substrate on the strain dependence of the gap. Additionally, we observed a transition from a direct to an indirect bandgap under strain, and (under an equal biaxial strain of 10\%) a semiconductor-to-metal transition, consistent with previous theoretical work.

# Entropy dynamics of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg chain

arXiv:2411.09368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the quench dynamics of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg spin chain. First, we develop a new algorithm, the ancilla TEBD method, which combines the purification technique and the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm to study the entanglement dynamics of binary bonded disordered spin chains. With the support of exact diagonalization (ED), we calculate the multifaractal dimension of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg spin model and study its dependence on the strength of the disorder potential; we find that the multifaractal dimension shows no critical behavior which rules out the existence of the many body localization transition. Then, we reproduce the long time scaling of the von Neumann entropy at the time scale that is beyond the reach of typical TEBD and time dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) algorithms. Based on the numerical analysis, we propose that such a long time scaling is due to the competition of the spin interaction and the disorder which can be seen as a new mechanism for the generating of long time scale entropy dynamics. At last, we numerically proved the existence of the transient Mpemba effect in the bond disordered Heisenberg chain.

# Implementation of time-dependent Hartree-Fock in real space

## 时间依赖的hartree-fock在真实空间中的实现

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01522

arXiv:2405.01522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) is one of the fundamental post-Hartree-Fock (HF) methods to describe excited states. In its Tamm-Dancoff form, equivalent to Configuration Interaction Singles, it is still widely used and particularly applicable to big molecules where more accurate methods may be unfeasibly expensive. However, it is rarely implemented in real space, mostly because of the expensive nature of the exact-exchange potential in real space. Compared to widely used Gaussian-type orbitals (GTO) basis sets, real space often offers easier implementation of equations and more systematic convergence of Rydberg states, as well as favorable scaling, effective domain parallelization, flexible boundary conditions, and ability to treat model systems. We implemented TDHF in the Octopus real-space code as a step toward linear-response hybrid time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), other post-HF methods, and ensemble density-functional theory methods involving exact exchange. Calculation of HF's non-local exact exchange is very expensive in real space. We overcome this limitation with Octopus' implementation of Adaptively Compressed Exchange (ACE), and find the appropriate mixing scheme and starting point to complete the ground-state calculation in a practical amount of time, and thus enable TDHF. We compared our results to those from GTOs on a set of small molecules and confirmed close agreement of results, though with larger deviations than in the case of semi-local TDDFT. We find that convergence of TDHF demands a finer real-space grid than semi-local TDDFT. We also present the subtleties in benchmarking a real-space calculation against GTOs, relating to Rydberg and vacuum states.

# Scaling Relations for Ammonia Oxidation

## 氨氧化的结垢关系

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-n35nl-v2?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

The ammonia oxidation reaction is a reaction of great interest for its potential to upcycle ammonia waste, creating fertilizer salts beneficial for the agricultural industry. Currently, AOR catalysts typically suffer either from high onset potentials or catalyst poisoning, and better catalyst materials must be found in order for AOR to be viable for large-scale fertilizer production. Experimentally, it is difficult to study the interactions of adsorbates on catalyst surfaces on an atomic level, whereas computational studies provide us with a means to study catalysts on this scale. In this study, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to develop linear scaling relations for ammonia oxidation using a set of ten reference metals. The scaling relations were used in a microkinetic model to predict the most active transition metal electrocatalysts for the AOR.

# Enhanced Electrochemical Detection of Dopamine and Uric Acid Using Au@Ni-MOF (Ni (CH 3 CO 2 ) 2 ) with Nickel Acetate Precursor and Employing 2D Structure for Density Functional Theory (DFT) Simulation

Rapid and efficient detection of small biomolecules in human body fluids is crucial to developing novel electrode materials. In this paper, one new type of no-enzyme electrochemical sensor based on the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) hybrids with the precursor of Ni(II) (nickel acetate) was fabricated through an in-situ grown strategy: [Ni3(BTC)2]n (H3BTC=1,3,5-trimesic acid) with coordinatively unsaturated Ni(II) sites decorated with gold nanoparticles to synthesize the Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) hybrids for the individual and simultaneous determination of dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA). The electrochemical performance of the as-prepared Au@Ni-MOF hybrids fabricated on the surface of the screen-printed electrode (SPCE) was investigated for the detection of different concentrations of DA and UA in the 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Moreover, the cathodic peak current for Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE was proportional to the DA and UA concentration over a specifically wide linear range of 0.1 &micro;M to 2 mM and 0.5 &micro;M to 1.5 mM, respectively. The obtained Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2)/SPCE showed excellent electrochemical and electrocatalytic performance owing to the perfectly assembled AuNPs and Ni-MOF, which can be applied in non-enzyme sensing of DA and UA. Furthermore, the adsorption energy and bond length of the 2D structures of Ni-MOF and Au@Ni-MOF (Ni(CH3CO2)2) were determined through DFT simulations. These calculations provided insights into the interactions between these biomolecules and the surfaces of these 2D structures.

# Comparison of Radioisotope Adsorption Capability in Metal Organic Frameworks through DFT Simulation

## 通过DFT模拟比较放射性同位素在金属有机框架中的吸附能力

We compared the adsorption performance of graphene and MOF-303 for three radionuclides of significant concern in radioactive waste: Co, Sr, and Cs, using density functional theory. Additionally, we doped MOF-303 with transition metals such as Cu, Ag, and Au by replacing the hydrogen atoms in the nitrogen linker, and investigated the resulting changes in adsorption capability. The adsorption capability of MOF-303 for the Co, Sr, and Cs was superior to the adsorption capability of graphene. Furthermore, doping MOF-303 with Cu, Ag, and Au further enhanced the adsorption capability of MOF-303 for Co, Sr, and Cs. Ag-MOF-303 exhibited significant improvement in Sr atom adsorption at specific sites. The adsorption improvement is likely due to the formation of new bonds between Ag-MOF-303 and the Sr atom, resulting from Ag doping. The assumption of new bond formation was confirmed by an increase in the density of states. While Ag-MOF-303 demonstrated superior performance in Sr atom adsorption at specific site, Au-MOF-303 resulted in the most significant overall increase in adsorption energy for Co, Sr, Cs among the Cu-MOF-303, Ag-MOF-303, and Au-MOF-303.
