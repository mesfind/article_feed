Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been experimentally shown to exhibit room-temperature single-photon emission. This emission is attributed to defect states in the wide band-gap of hBN, which allow new optical transitions between these dispersion-less defect levels. In this work, we study the new spectral features introduced by interacting atomic defects in consecutive layers of bilayer hBN. Density Functional theory simulations have been carried out to calculate the energy band structure, frequency-dependent complex dielectric functions, and Kohn-Sham states to demonstrate and understand the cause of the emission enhancements. We found that placing colour centres in the vicinity of each other in bilayer hBN introduces new polarization dependent spectral features, with strong dependence on the distance and relative orientation between atomic defects. Our results provide a pathway to engineering single photon emission in hBN via inter-defect interaction.

Abstract: In this article, we study the quench dynamics of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg spin chain. First, we develop a new algorithm, the ancilla TEBD method, which combines the purification technique and the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm to study the entanglement dynamics of binary bonded disordered spin chains. With the support of exact diagonalization (ED), we calculate the the multifaractal dimension of the binary bond disordered Heisenberg spin model and study its dependence on the strength of the disorder potential; we find no critical behavior which rules out the existence of the many body localization transition. Then, we reproduce the long time scaling of the von Neumann entropy at the time scale that is beyond the reach of typical TEBD and time dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) algorithms. Based on the numerical analysis, we propose that such a long time scaling is due to the competition of the spin interaction and the disorder which can be seen as a new mechanism for the generating of long time scale entropy dynamics. At last, we numerically proved the existence of the transient Mpemba effect in the bond disordered Heisenberg chain.

# How orbitals and oxidation states determine apparent topographies in scanning tunneling microscopy: the case of fluorine on silver surfaces

## 轨道和氧化态如何确定扫描隧道显微镜中的表观形貌: 银表面上氟的情况

Abstract: We use density functional theory calculations to characterize the early stages of fluorination of silver's (100) and (110) surfaces. In the Ag(100) surface, the hollow site is the most favorable for F adatoms. In the Ag(110) surface, three adsorption sites, namely hollow, long bridge, and short bridge, exhibit similar energies. These locations are also more favorable than an F adatom occupying a vacancy site irrespectively of whether the vacancy was present or not in the pristine surface. The computed energy as a function of surface coverage is used to compute the equilibrium thermodynamics phase diagram. We argue that for the typical pressure and temperature of fluorination experiments, the state of the surface is not determined by thermodynamics but by kinetics. Combining these results with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) topographic simulations, we propose assignments to features observed experimentally. We present a minimal model of the apparent topography of adatoms in different locations in terms of hydrogenic orbitals, explaining the observed trends. The model links the STM apparent topography to structural information and the oxidation states of the Ag atoms near the adatom.

Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, particularly such as the one based density functional theory, as well as high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.

# Scattering of CO from Vacant-MoSe$_2$ with O Adsorbates: Is CO$_2$ Formed?

## 用O吸附物从空置的MoSe $_2 $ 中散射CO: CO $_2 $ 形成了吗？

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14362

arXiv:2409.14362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, based on density functional theory that also accounts for van der Waals interactions, we study the oxidation of gas phase CO on MoSe$_2$ with a Se vacancy and oxygen coverage of 0.125~ML. In the equilibrium configuration, one of the O atoms is adsorbed on the vacancy and the other one atop one Se atom. Recombination of the CO molecule with the second of these O atoms to form CO$_2$ is a highly exothermic reaction, with an energy gain of around 3~eV. The likeliness of the CO oxidation reaction on this surface is next examined by calculating hundreds of AIMD trajectories for incidence energies that suffice to overcome the energy barriers in the entrance channel of the CO oxidative recombination. In spite of it, no CO$_2$ formation event is obtained. In most of the calculated trajectories the incoming CO molecule is directly reflected and in some cases, mainly at low energies, the molecules remain trapped at the surface but without reacting. As important conclusion, our AIMD simulations show that the recombination of CO molecules with adsorbed O atoms is a very unlikely reaction in this system, despite its large exothermicity.

# Polariton Spectra under the Collective Coupling Regime. II. 2D Non-linear Spectra

In our previous work [Ref.~\citenum{MondalJCP2024paper1}], we developed several efficient strategies to simulate exciton-polariton dynamics described by the Holestein-Tavis-Cummings (HTC) Hamiltonian under the collective coupling regime. Here, we incorporated these strategies into the previously developed $\mathcal{L}$-PLDM approach for simulating 2D Electronic Spectroscopy (2DES) spectra of exciton-polariton under the collective coupling regime. In particular, we apply the efficient quantum dynamics propagation scheme developed in Paper I to both the forward and the backward propagations in the PLDM, and develop an efficient important sampling scheme and GPU vectorization scheme that allow us to reduce the computational costs from $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{K}^2)\mathcal{O}(T^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{K}) \mathcal{O}(T^0)$ for the 2DES spectra simulation, where $\mathcal{K}$ is the number of states and $T$ is the number of time steps of propagation. We further simulated the 2DES spectra for an HTC Hamiltonian under the collective coupling regime and analyzed the signal from both rephasing and non-rephasing contributions of the ground state bleaching (GSB), excited state emission (ESA), and stimulated emission (SE) pathways.

# From Micro-Environments to Macroscopic Effects: How the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Drives Cu Cathodic Corrosion

## 从微观环境到宏观效应: 碱性析氢反应如何驱动Cu阴极腐蚀

Cathodic corrosion of copper (Cu) has posed a significant challenge for over a century, impeding various technological progresses such as electrochemical conversion of CO2 (eCO2RR) into fuels and other value-added carbon products. In this study, employing a combined Density Functional Theory (DFT) and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation approach, we delve into the atomistic level mechanism driving this phenomenon in Cu. Our hypothesis posits the pivotal role of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in facilitating cathodic corrosion in Cu. We rigorously develop a pH-dependent hydroxide (OH) adsorption mechanism and calculate the equilibrium OH coverage (𝜃OH) at varying pH levels, the thermodynamic stability of subsurface oxygen (Osub), as well as the Cu-vacancy mediated diffusion of subsurface oxygens (Osub). Through comprehensive analysis, we establish correlation among various microenvironments, including oxygen diffusion in subsurface layers, pH-dependent OH adsorption, and Cu dissolution into the electrolyte as (Cu- OH) complexes. Furthermore, our investigation explores the correlation between surface coordination environment of active sites and cathodic corrosion of Cu. Finally, by integrating DFT- derived thermodynamic data into a kMC model, we successfully predict the formation of experimentally observed corrosion pits on Cu-surfaces. This combined approach not only advances our fundamental understanding of Cu cathodic corrosion but also offers insights crucial for developing effective corrosion mitigation strategies.

# Pristine and Cu-decorated ψ-graphene-based materials for CO2 activation: A DFT(D)+ U Study

Capturing and repurposing anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) is the traditional way to deal with climate change and lack of fossil fuel. CO2 adsorption (reduction) is the first step in this process. We have employed density functional theory-based calculations to investigate CO2 activation over the pristine and Cu-decorated carbon-based two-dimensional ψ-graphene material and its hydrogenated forms, i.e., ψ-graphone (half hydrogenated) and ψ-graphane (fully hydrogenated). ψ-graphene is a metallic allotrope of graphene containing 5-6-7 membered carbon rings. Our study found exothermic binding of CO2 with all three materials (for both pristine and Cu-decorated materials), indicating spontaneous physisorption. The presence of single atoms of the transition metal plays a significant role in increasing the activity of materials towards CO2 activation. We observed that the adsorption energy increases about three times after decorating a ψ-graphene sheet with Cu atoms. In contrast, no significant variation is observed on ψ-graphone or ψ-graphane materials. Our Bader charge analysis confirms the charge transfer from 2d nano-sheets to the molecule, where the values of calculated adsorption energies and the density of states suggest that the interaction between CO2 and these three materials can be categorized as weak physisorption., while Cu decoration enhances the CO2 adsorption.

# Stepwise kinetics of the Early-Stage Nucleation in Chiral Perovskites via Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics and Free- Energy Calculations

## 通过从头算分子动力学和自由能计算在手性钙钛矿中早期成核的逐步动力学

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-2nd8t?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

This study provides a comprehensive molecular-level understanding of the early-stage nucleation process in chiral hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs). A combination of ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) based on density functional theory (DFT) and parallel bias metadynamics simulations was designed to explore a broad spectrum of the nucleation scenarios, disclosing how structural deviations affect the formation of chiral aggregates at the atomic scale. The workflow uses parallel replicas initialized from configurations characterised by different root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) relative to the crystallographic coordinates of the chiral ligands. The free-energy landscape and the kinetic pathways involved in chiral aggregate formation indicate a stepwise mechanism that governs the transition from disordered to chiral states. The computed free-energy barriers and corresponding transition timescales uncover several critical stages in this process, including rapid initial relaxations as well as slower, free-energy-intensive steps, with overall timescales on the order of microseconds as the system approaches its most chiral configuration.

# Azide- and Transition-Metal-Free Access to Sulfonyl Amidines via C(sp2)-N Coupling of Trifluoroborate-Iminiums with N-Fluorobenzenesulfonimide

## 通过三氟硼酸亚氨基与N-氟苯磺酰亚胺的C(sp2)-N偶联获得无叠氮化物和过渡金属的磺酰基脒

Amidines are an important class of organic compounds with widespread application as superbases, nucleophilic cata-lysts, and building blocks of heterocyclic compounds in organic synthesis. Moreover, they represent an important struc-tural motif in medicinal chemistry. This work describes an application of primary trifluoroborate‐iminiums in unprece-dented azide- and transition-metal-free transformation to N-sulfonyl amidines in the presence of N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide. This novel C(sp2)-N bond-forming reaction proceeds without excess of any reagent under mild conditions and provides good to high yields of N-sulfonyl amidines by a simple isolation procedure. Density functional theory mechanistic studies into this novel transformation support that the use of a base is required to activate either the trifluoroborate-iminium or the NFSI and promote the C(sp2)-N bond formation via nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen. The utility of the developed methodology is showcased with the synthesis of two bioactive compounds.
