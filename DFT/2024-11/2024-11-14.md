Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is key for understanding many properties of materials such as superconductivity and electric resistivity. Although first principles density-functional-theory (DFT) based EPC calculations are used widely, their efficacy is limited by the accuracy and efficiency of the underlying exchange-correlation functionals. These limitations become exacerbated in complex $d$- and $f$-electron materials, where beyond-DFT approaches and empirical corrections, such as the Hubbard $U$, are commonly invoked. Here, using the examples of CoO and NiO, we show how the efficient r2scan density functional correctly captures strong EPC effects in transition-metal oxides without requiring the introduction of empirical parameters. We also demonstrate the ability of r2scan to accurately model phonon-mediated superconducting properties of the main group compounds (e.g., MgB$_2$), with improved electronic bands and phonon dispersions over those of traditional density functionals. Our study provides a pathway for extending the scope of accurate first principles modeling of electron-phonon interactions to encompass complex $d$-electron materials.

Abstract: The outcome of continuously measuring a quantum system is a string of data whose intricate correlation properties reflect the underlying quantum dynamics. In this paper we study the role of these correlation in reconstructing the probabilities of finite sequences of outcomes, the so-called empirical distributions. Our approach is cast in terms of generic quantum instruments, and therefore encompass all types of sequential and continuous quantum measurements. We also show how this specializes to important cases, such as quantum jumps. To quantify the precise role of correlations, we introduce a relative-entropy based measure that quantifies the range of correlations in the string, and the influence that these correlations have in reconstructing finite sequences.

# Microscopic Theory of Polariton Group Velocity Renormalization

Abstract: Cavity exciton-polaritons exhibit ballistic transport and can achieve a distance of 100 $\mu $m in one picosecond. This ballistic transport significantly enhances mobility compared to that of bare excitons, which often move diffusively and become the bottleneck for energy conversion and transfer devices. Despite being robustly reproduced in experiments and simulations, there is no comprehensive microscopic theory addressing the group velocity of polariton transport, and its renormalization due to phonon scattering while still preserving this ballistic behavior. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory to describe the group velocity renormalization using a finite-temperature Green's function approach. Utilizing the generalized Holstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, we analytically derive an expression for the group velocity renormalization and find that it is caused by phonon-mediated transitions from the lower polariton states to the dark states. The theory predicts that the magnitude of group velocity renormalization scales linearly with the phonon bath reorganization energy under weak coupling conditions and also linearly depends on the temperature in the high-temperature regime. These predictions are numerically verified using quantum dynamics simulations via the mean-field Ehrenfest method, demonstrating quantitative agreement. Our findings provide theoretical insights and a predictive analytical framework that advance the understanding and design of cavity-modified semiconductors and molecular ensembles, opening new avenues for engineered polaritonic devices.

Abstract: The exact quantum dynamics of lattice models can be computationally intensive, especially when aiming for large system sizes and extended simulation times necessary to converge transport coefficients. By leveraging finite memory times to access long-time dynamics using only short-time data, generalized master equations (GMEs) can offer a route to simulating the dynamics of lattice problems efficiently. However, such simulations are limited to small lattices whose dynamics exhibit finite-size artifacts that contaminate transport coefficient predictions. To address this problem, we introduce a novel approach that exploits finite memory in time \textit{and} space to efficiently predict the many-body dynamics of dissipative lattice problems involving short-range interactions. This advance enables one to leverage the short-time dynamics of small lattices to simulate arbitrarily large systems over long times. We demonstrate the strengths of this method by focusing on nonequilibrium polaron relaxation and transport in the dispersive Holstein model, successfully simulating lattice dynamics in one and two dimensions free from finite-size effects, reducing the computational expense of such simulations by multiple orders of magnitude. Our method is broadly applicable and provides an accurate and efficient means to investigate nonequilibrium relaxation with microscopic resolution over mesoscopic length and time scales that are relevant to experiment.

Abstract: We study the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix in the giant connected component of Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, with average connectivity $p$ and randomly distributed hopping amplitudes. By solving the self-consistent cavity equations satisfied by the matrix elements of the resolvent, we compute the probability distribution of the local density of states, which governs the scaling with the system size of the moments of the eigenvectors' amplitudes, as well as several other observables related to the spectral statistics. For small values of $p>1$ above the percolation threshold, we unveil the presence of an exotic delocalized but (weakly) multifractal phase in a broad region of the parameter space, which separates the localized phase found for $p\le1$ from the fully-delocalized GOE-like phase expected for $p\to \infty$. We explore the fundamental physical mechanism underlying the emergence of delocalized multifractal states, rooted in the pronounced heterogeneity in the topology of the graph. This heterogeneity arises from the interplay between strong fluctuations in local degrees and hopping amplitudes, and leads to an effective fragmentation of the graph. We further support our findings by characterizing the level statistics and the two-point spatial correlations within the multifractal phase, and address the ensuing anomalous transport and relaxation properties affecting the quantum dynamical evolution.

Abstract: We present a framework for simulating the open dynamics of spin-boson systems by combining variational non-Gaussian states with a quantum trajectories approach.

Abstract: The anisotropic potential energy surface of the (H$_2$)$_2$ dimer represents a challenging problem for many-body methods. Here, we determine the potential energy curves of five different dimer configurations (T, Z, X, H, L) using the lattice regularized diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method and a number of approximate functionals within density functional theory (DFT), including advanced orbital-dependent functionals based on the random phase approximation (RPA). We assess their performance in describing the potential wells, bond distances and relative energies. The repulsive potential wall is studied by looking at the relative stability of the different dimer configurations as a function of an applied force acting along the intermolecular axis. It is shown that most functionals within DFT break down at finite compression, even those that give an accurate description around the potential well minima. Only by including exchange within RPA a qualitatively correct description along the entire potential energy curve is obtained. Finally, we discuss these results in the context of solid molecular hydrogen at finite pressures.

# Mechanistic Insights into CO and H2 Oxidation on Cu/CeO2 Single Atom Catalysts: A Computational Investigation

## 对Cu/CeO2单原子催化剂上CO和H2氧化的机理见解: 计算研究

Single atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted significant interest due to their unique properties and potential for enhancing catalytic performance in various chemical reactions. In this study, we atomistically explore adsorption properties and catalytic performance of single Cu atoms anchored at low-index CeO2 surfaces, focusing on the oxidation of CO and H2. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we report that Cu adatoms bind favorably on different CeO2 surfaces, following a stability order of (100)>(110)>(111). The charge transfer from a single adsorbed Cu atom to Ce leads to the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and the oxidation of Cu0 to Cu+. This strengthens molecular bonds at Cu sites, particularly for CO due to the less populated d-band, while H2 shows a by ~1 eV weaker adsorption. CO oxidation is energetically more favorable than H2 oxidation on the Cu/CeO2(111) surface. The rate-controlling steps for the Mars-van Krevelen oxidation involve the formation of a bent CO2- intermediate for CO and H2O for H2. The lattice oxygen atom at the interface plays a key role for both oxidation processes. Our findings highlight the potential of single atom catalyst, Cu/CeO2, for CO adsorption and oxidation in heterogeneous catalysis.

Single-Molecule Junctions (SMJs) are key platforms for the exploration of electron transport at the molecular scale.  In this work, we present a method that employs different exchange-correlation density functionals for the molecule and the electrode domains in an SMJ, allowing us to choose the optimal one for each part. This is accomplished using a formally exact projection-based DFT-in-DFT embedding technique combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method to predict the zero-bias conductance. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through transport calculations on SMJs with benzene-1,4-diamine (BDA) and its tetramethylated and tetrafluorinated variants using the CAM-B3LYP range-separated hybrid functional for the embedded molecule and the PBE functional for the electrodes.  The findings indicate a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the predicted zero-bias conductance compared to traditional modeling using the PBE functional across the entire system. The causes for the noted improvement are demonstrated through the examination of alterations in the energy levels of the embedded molecule, along with variations in the electrode-molecule interactions.

# Photodissociation Dynamics of Indole using Multi-Configuration Time-dependent Hartree Method

## 基于多构型时间依赖Hartree方法的吲哚光解离动力学研究

Indole, being a biologically relevant and abundant chromophore, is a prime molecule of interest both in experimental and computational research.  In previous works, the nature of the dissociative states for indole and indole derivatives were predicted. In this work, the N-H photodissociation dynamics of indole have been studied using nonadiabatic quantum dynamics. First, the important vibrational modes responsible for the photodissociation were detected using vibrational analysis. Potential energy cuts (PECs) along important vibrational modes have been calculated using the complete active space self-consistent field (CASPT2) method with (10,9) active space. The multi-mode multi-state model vibronic Hamiltonian is constructed by the parameters obtained from the fitting of ab initio PECs, including Morse and harmonic functions, and vibronic couplings. Nonadiabatic quantum dynamics is performed using the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, considering four electronic states and four vibrational modes. N-H stretching mode, Q42 turns out to be the most important of all modes, showing an anharmonic, dissociative 𝛑-𝛔* state at the third excited state. The out-of-plane C-N-H bending i.e. mode Q3 is found to facilitate the dissociation process. Additionally, effects of inclusion of Q8 and Q17, which are mixed motion modes with contribution from N-H displacement, were also assessed. Two timescales obtained from the population dynamics, 37 fs and 383 fs, are attributed to internal conversion from the second excited La state to the 𝛑-𝛔* states and photodissociation at the 𝛑-𝛔*, respectively, and are in good agreement with timescales obtained from femtosecond time-resolved ionization experiments. After 500 fs of dynamic propagation, around 55% reaction probability for N-H fission in indole is recorded.  This study of photofission of indole is crucial for understanding photodynamics of similar large molecules with high accuracy.

# Atomic-Scale Observation of Moiré potential in Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride Layers by Electron Microscopy

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hbbfj?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Moiré superlattices (MSLs) are an emerging class of two-dimensional materials whose electronic states can be tuned by the twist angle between two van der Waals layers and/or the relative placement of the layers. As the twist angle increases (decreases), the resulting MSLs tend to have a shorter (longer) wavelength pattern with in general incommensurate (com-mensurate) patterns, forming an underlying moiré potential depending on the twist angle. Irrespective of the commensura-bility/ incommensurability of MSLs, atomic-scale observation of the moiré potential is quite challenging, and the details of their interlayer interactions and the related anomalous effects such as correlated superconductivity and anomalous quan-tum Hall effects are still elusive. In this work, we show that aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy allows us to obtain atomic-scale image of the moiré potentials both in the commensurate and incommensurate states. For this pur-pose, we use atomically clean and strain-free hexagonal boron nitride nanolayers, which are fabricated by a chemical exfo-liation method developed especially in this work. Even in the case of incommensurate state, the local interlayer atomic overlap plays a decisive role in determining the resulting moiré potentials, as supported by density functional theory calcu-lations. This work not only provides a general strategy to observe the moiré potential in MSLs, but it also expands the ap-plication of electron microcopy to the further study of MSLs with atomic resolution.

# Mercury Removal Mechanism of Elemental Sulfur-Modified Activated Carbon Based on Density Functional Theory

## 基于密度泛函理论的单质硫改性活性炭脱汞机理研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5296955/latest

Sulfur-modified activated carbon is a mercury removal adsorbent with broad application prospects. However, research on the mercury adsorption mechanisms and the influence of different adsorption sites on mercury adsorption on sulfur-loaded activated carbon is limited. In this study, the mechanism of mercury adsorption on sulfur-modified activated carbon and the influence of the adsorption were investigated using quantum chemical calculations. A cluster model of the activated carbon surface was established to determine the bonding characteristics, adsorption energy, electrostatic potential, and molecular orbitals of Hg0 for different activated carbon substrate structures. The results indicated that one to two C-S bonds were formed when a single sulfur atom was loaded onto the surface of a carbon cluster in a process involving both chemisorption and physisorption. Among several configurations, the SAC-Arm-1 configuration had the highest adsorption energy (-65.47 kJ/mol). Electrostatic potential analysis revealed that when adsorption occurred at the adsorption site of this structure, Hg was surrounded by a positive electrostatic potential, whereas S was surrounded by a negative electrostatic potential. Under the action of electrostatic forces, sulfur, and mercury tend to move closer to each other, indicating chemisorption between them. Frontier orbital analysis revealed a noticeable change in the orbital spin direction at this adsorption site, with similar changes in the post-adsorption orbitals. Orbital overlap in the system was slightly more frequent, indicating easier electron exchange, further proving that the adsorption reaction is prone to occur. By comparing the adsorption energies and exploring the adsorption mechanisms of the different sulfur-loaded carbon cluster models and different adsorption sites, this study provides guidance for the future development of efficient sulfur-modified carbon-based adsorbents.
