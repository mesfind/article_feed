<p>Nature Communications, Published online: 17 November 2024; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54375-y">doi:10.1038/s41467-024-54375-y</a></p>The authors used deep metric learning to characterize 650 neuroactive compounds by zebrafish behavioral profiles. After redesigning a large screen to overcome AI/ML shortcut learning, zebrafish behavioral similarity found compounds acting on the same human receptors as structurally dissimilar drugs.
