The Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) is a primary method for nuclear component fabrication and repair. Recent advancements in monitoring and automation technologies have made the shift toward fully automated arc welding more feasible, reducing the necessity for continuous human oversight. Two artificial intelligence-based networks were developed that utilize sensor-based feedback on a mechanized GTAW head. We present an image-based semantic segmentation convolutional neural network that identifies crucial features such as the weld pool, groove, wire, and electrode based on which geometric measurements are derived. A separate novel neural network predicts the weld bead geometry for multi-pass welds and inconsistent groove geometries. The application of both neural networks is a pre-requisite that enables the autonomous planning and execution of multi-pass welds to fill a groove.
