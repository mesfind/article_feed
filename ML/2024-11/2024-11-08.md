# The tricritical point of tricritical directed percolation is determined based on neural network

## 基于神经网络确定三相定向渗流的三相点

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04537

arXiv:2411.04537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, neural networks have increasingly been employed to identify critical points of phase transitions. For the tricritical directed percolation model, its steady-state configurations encompass both first-order and second-order phase transitions. Due to the presence of crossover effects, identifying the critical points of phase transitions becomes challenging. This study utilizes Monte Carlo simulations to obtain steady-state configurations under different probabilities $p$ and $q$, and by calculating the increments in average particle density, we observe first-order transitions, second-order transitions, and regions where both types of transitions interact.These Monte Carlo-generated steady-state configurations are used as input to construct and train a convolutional neural network, from which we determine the critical points $p_{c}$ for different probabilities $q$. Furthermore, by learning the steady-state configurations associated with the superheated point $p=p_u$, we locate the tricritical point at $q_{t}=0.893$. Simultaneously, we employed a three-output CNN model to obtain the phase transition boundaries and the range of the crossover regions. Our method offers a neural network-based approach to capture critical points and distinguish phase transition boundaries, providing a novel solution to this problem.

# Single replica spin-glass phase detection using field variation and machine learning

## 使用场变化和机器学习的单副本自旋玻璃相位检测

arXiv:2411.04567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model used the replica symmetry method to find the phase transition of the system. In 1979-1980, Parisi proposed a solution based on replica symmetry breaking (RSB), which allowed him to identify the underlying phases of complex systems such as spin-glasses. Regardless of the method used for detection, the intrinsic phase of a system exists whether or not replicas are considered. We introduce a single replica method of spin-glass phase detection using the field's variation experienced by each spin in a system configuration. This method focuses on a single replica with quenched random couplings. Each spin inevitably observes a different field from the others. Our results show that the mean and variance of fields named "Spontaneous Configurational Field" experienced by spins are suitable indicators to explore different ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and mixed phases. To classify different phases of the system with defined indicators we have developed an algorithm based on machine learning to analyze the desired samples.

# Insight into the effect of force error on the thermal conductivity from machine-learned potentials

## 从机器学习的电位洞察力误差对热导率的影响

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04769

arXiv:2411.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have been extensively used to obtain the lattice thermal conductivity via atomistic simulations. However, the impact of force errors in various MLPs on thermal transport has not been widely recognized and remains to be fully understood. Here, we employ MLP-driven molecular dynamics (MD) and anharmonic lattice dynamics (LD) to systematically investigate how the calculated thermal conductivity varies with the force errors, using boron arsenide as a prototypical material. We consistently observe an underestimation of thermal conductivity in MD simulations with three different MLPs including the neuroevolution potential, deep potential, and moment tensor potential. We provide a robust extrapolation scheme based on controlled force noises via the Langevin thermostat to correct this underestimation. The corrected results achieve a good agreement with previous experimental measurement from 200 K to 600 K. In contrast, the thermal conductivity values from LD calculations with MLPs readily align with the experimental data, which is attributed to the much smaller effects of the force errors on the force-constant calculations.

# Machine learning and optimization-based approaches to duality in statistical physics

## 统计物理中基于机器学习和优化的对偶方法

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04838

arXiv:2411.04838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of duality -- that a given physical system can have two different mathematical descriptions -- is a key idea in modern theoretical physics. Establishing a duality in lattice statistical mechanics models requires the construction of a dual Hamiltonian and a map from the original to the dual observables. By using simple neural networks to parameterize these maps and introducing a loss function that penalises the difference between correlation functions in original and dual models, we formulate the process of duality discovery as an optimization problem. We numerically solve this problem and show that our framework can rediscover the celebrated Kramers-Wannier duality for the 2d Ising model, reconstructing the known mapping of temperatures. We also discuss an alternative approach which uses known features of the mapping of topological lines to reduce the problem to optimizing the couplings in a dual Hamiltonian, and explore next-to-nearest neighbour deformations of the 2d Ising duality. We discuss future directions and prospects for discovering new dualities within this framework.

# On the hardness of learning ground state entanglement of geometrically local Hamiltonians

## 关于学习几何局部哈密顿量的基态纠缠的硬度

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04353

arXiv:2411.04353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the entanglement structure of ground states of local Hamiltonians is a fundamental problem in quantum information. In this work we study the computational complexity of this problem, given the Hamiltonian as input. Our main result is that to show it is cryptographically hard to determine if the ground state of a geometrically local, polynomially gapped Hamiltonian on qudits ($d=O(1)$) has near-area law vs near-volume law entanglement. This improves prior work of Bouland et al. (arXiv:2311.12017) showing this for non-geometrically local Hamiltonians. In particular we show this problem is roughly factoring-hard in 1D, and LWE-hard in 2D. Our proof works by constructing a novel form of public-key pseudo-entanglement which is highly space-efficient, and combining this with a modification of Gottesman and Irani's quantum Turing machine to Hamiltonian construction. Our work suggests that the problem of learning so-called "gapless" quantum phases of matter might be intractable.

# Efficiency of the hidden fermion determinant states Ansatz in the light of different complexity measures

arXiv:2411.04527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding reliable approximations to the quantum many-body problem is one of the central challenges of modern physics. Elemental to this endeavor is the development of advanced numerical techniques pushing the limits of what is tractable. One such recently proposed numerical technique are neural quantum states. This new type of wavefunction based Ans\"atze utilizes the expressivity of neural networks to tackle fundamentally challenging problems, such as the Mott transition. In this paper we aim to gauge the universalness of one representative of neural network Ans\"atze, the hidden-fermion slater determinant approach. To this end, we study five different fermionic models each displaying volume law scaling of the entanglement entropy. For these, we correlate the effectiveness of the Ansatz with different complexity measures. Each measure indicates a different complexity in the absence of which a conventional Ansatz becomes efficient. We provide evidence that whenever one of the measures indicates proximity to a parameter region in which a conventional approach would work reliable, the neural network approach also works reliable and efficient. This highlights the great potential, but also challenges for neural network approaches: Finding suitable points in theory space around which to construct the Ansatz in order to be able to efficiently treat models unsuitable for their current designs.

# Quantum adiabatic optimization with Rydberg arrays: localization phenomena and encoding strategies

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04645

arXiv:2411.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of the encoding scheme proposed in [Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023)], which encodes optimization problems on graphs with arbitrary connectivity into Rydberg atom arrays. Here, a graph vertex is represented by a wire of atoms, and the (crossing) crossing-with-edge gadget is placed at the intersection of two wires to (de)couple their degrees of freedom and reproduce the graph connectivity. We consider the fundamental geometry of two vertex-wires intersecting via a single gadget and look at minimum gap scaling with system size along adiabatic protocols. We find that both polynomial and exponential scaling are possible and, by means of perturbation theory, we relate the exponential closing of the minimum gap to an unfavorable localization of the ground-state wavefunction. Then, on the QuEra Aquila neutral atom machine, we observe such localization and its effect on the success probability of finding the correct solution to the encoded optimization problem. Finally, we propose possible strategies to avoid this quantum bottleneck, leading to an exponential improvement in the adiabatic performance.

# Diabatic states of charge transfer with constrained charge equilibration

## 具有受限电荷平衡的非绝热电荷转移状态

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04807

arXiv:2411.04807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge transfer (CT) processes that are electronically non-adiabatic are ubiquitous in chemistry, biology, and materials science, but their theoretical description requires diabatic states or adiabatic excited states. For complex systems, these latter states are more difficult to calculate than the adiabatic ground state. Here, we propose a simple method to obtain diabatic states, including energies and charges, by constraining the atomic charges within the charge equilibration framework. For two-state systems, the exact diabatic coupling can be determined, from which the adiabatic excited-state energy can also be calculated. The method can be viewed as an affordable alternative to constrained density functional theory (CDFT), and so we call it constrained charge equilibration (CQEq). We test the CQEq method on the anthracene-tetracyanoethylene CT complex and the reductive decomposition of ethylene carbonate on a lithium metal surface. We find that CQEq predicts diabatic energies, charges, and adiabatic excitation energies in good agreement with CDFT, and we propose that CQEq is promising for combination with machine learning force fields to study non-adiabatic CT in the condensed phase.

# Adaptive energy reference for machine-learning models of the electronic density of states

## 电子态密度机器学习模型的自适应能量参考

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01068

arXiv:2407.01068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) provides information regarding the distribution of electronic energy levels in a material, and can be used to approximate its optical and electronic properties and therefore guide computational material design. Given its usefulness and relative simplicity, it has been one of the first electronic properties used as target for machine-learning approaches going beyond interatomic potentials. A subtle but important point, well-appreciated in the condensed matter community but usually overlooked in the construction of data-driven models, is that for bulk configurations the absolute energy reference of single-particle energy levels is ill-defined. Only energy differences matter, and quantities derived from the DOS are typically independent on the absolute alignment. We introduce an adaptive scheme that optimizes the energy reference of each structure as part of the training process, and show that it consistently improves the quality of ML models compared to traditional choices of energy reference, for different classes of materials and different model architectures. On a practical level, we trace the improved performance to the ability of this self-aligning scheme to match the most prominent features in the DOS. More broadly, we believe that this work highlights the importance of incorporating insights into the nature of the physical target into the definition of the architecture and of the appropriate figures of merit for machine-learning models, that translate in better transferability and overall performance.

# Temporal Complexity of a Hopfield-Type Neural Model in Random and Scale-Free Graphs

## 随机和无标度图中Hopfield型神经模型的时间复杂度

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12895

arXiv:2406.12895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield network model and its generalizations were introduced as a model of associative, or content-addressable, memory. They were widely investigated both as an unsupervised learning method in artificial intelligence and as a model of biological neural dynamics in computational neuroscience. The complexity features of biological neural networks have attracted the scientific community's interest for the last two decades. More recently, concepts and tools borrowed from complex network theory were applied to artificial neural networks and learning, thus focusing on the topological aspects. However, the temporal structure is also a crucial property displayed by biological neural networks and investigated in the framework of systems displaying complex intermittency. The Intermittency-Driven Complexity (IDC) approach indeed focuses on the metastability of self-organized states, whose signature is a power-decay in the inter-event time distribution or a scaling behaviour in the related event-driven diffusion processes. The investigation of IDC in neural dynamics and its relationship with network topology is still in its early stages. In this work, we present the preliminary results of an IDC analysis carried out on a bio-inspired Hopfield-type neural network comparing two different connectivities, i.e., scale-free vs. random network topology. We found that random networks can trigger complexity features similar to that of scale-free networks, even if with some differences and for different parameter values, in particular for different noise levels

Abstract: Despite an artificial intelligence-assisted modeling of disordered crystals is a widely used and well-tried method of new materials design, the issues of its robustness, reliability, and stability are still not resolved and even not discussed enough. To highlight it, in this work we composed a series of nested intermetallic approximants of quasicrystals datasets and trained various machine learning models on them correspondingly. Our qualitative and, what is more important, quantitative assessment of the difference in the predictions clearly shows that different reasonable changes in the training sample can lead to the completely different set of the predicted potentially new materials. We also showed the advantage of pre-training and proposed a simple yet effective trick of sequential training to increase stability.

arXiv:2411.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although most teachers acknowledge the importance of taking investigative approached in students' science learning experiences, implementing them in high-school classes can be challenging for teachers. In this work, we analyzed data from multiple sources from a teaching Community of Practice (CoP) to investigate (a) barriers to using open-ended labs in physics classes, (b) shifts in teachers' beliefs about the use of open-ended labs in their classes during teachers' engagement in a physics teacher CoP in a partnership program, and (c) a case study of one teachers whose shifts in perceptions about open-ended labs led to her successful implementation of an open-ended lab in her class. The findings confirm the existence of well-known psychological and structural barriers that can prevent teachers from adopting investigative approaches in teaching physics labs. Moreover, we learned how the interaction of these barriers further complicates the adoption of open-ended approaches in physics classes. The study also revealed a significant gap between teachers' current practices and their desired method for conducting labs, particularly in terms of structured versus open-ended approaches. The case study offered deeper insights into how shifts in teaching practices occur through changes in perceptions within a supportive CoP.

# Lagrangian Drifter Path Identification and Prediction: SINDy vs Neural ODE

arXiv:2411.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the performance of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm and the neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in identification of the underlying mechanisms of open ocean Lagrangian drifter hydrodynamics with possible applications in coastal and port hydrodynamic processes. With this motivation we employ two different Lagrangian drifter datasets acquired by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s surface buoys with proper World Meteorological Organization (WMO) numbers. In the SINDy approach, the primary goal is to identify the drifter paths of buoys using ordinary differential equation sets with a minimal number of sparse coefficients. In the neural ODE approach, the goal is to identify the derivative of the hidden state of a neural network (NN). Using the acquired data, we examine the applicability of the SINDy and the neural ODE algorithms in identification of the drifter trajectories comparatively. We propose that while both of the algorithms may give acceptable results for open ocean, the SINDy-based algorithmic approach can predict the Lagrangian drifter paths more accurately and consistently at least for the datasets investigated and parameters selected. A discussion of our findings with potential applications in search and rescue missions in the open ocean, their limitations and applicability are also presented.

Abstract: Memristors, which are characterized by their unique input-voltage-history-dependent resistance, have garnered significant attention for the exploration of next-generation in-memory computing, reconfigurable logic circuits, and neural networks. Memristors are controlled by the applied input voltage; however, the latent potential of their magnetic field sensitivity for spintronics applications has rarely been explored. In particular, valuable functionalities are expected to be yielded by combining their history dependence and magnetic field response. Here, for the first time, we reveal a giant memory function based on the magnetic field history of memristive switching, with an extremely large magnetoresistance ratio of up to 32,900% under a constant bias voltage, using a two-terminal Ge-channel device with Fe/MgO electrodes. We attribute this behavior to colossal magnetoresistive switching induced by the d0 ferromagnetism of Mg vacancies in the MgO layers and impact ionization breakdown in the Ge substrate. Our findings may lead to the development of highly sensitive multi-field sensors, high-performance magnetic memory, and advanced neuromorphic devices.

# Defiltering turbulent flow fields for Lagrangian particle tracking using machine learning techniques

## 使用机器学习技术对湍流场进行滤波以进行拉格朗日粒子跟踪

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04384

arXiv:2411.04384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a defiltering method of turbulent flow fields for Lagrangian particle tracking using machine learning techniques. Numerical simulation of Lagrangian particle tracking is commonly used in various fields. In general, practical applications require an affordable grid size due to the limitation of computational resources; for instance, a large-eddy simulation reduces the number of grid points with a filtering operator. However, low resolution flow fields usually underestimate the fluctuations of particle velocity. We thus present a novel approach to defilter the fluid velocity to improve the particle motion in coarse-grid (i.e., filtered) fields. The proposed method, which is based on the machine learning techniques, intends to reconstruct the fluid velocity at a particle location. We assess this method in a priori manner using a turbulent channel flow at the friction Reynolds number ${\rm Re}_\tau=$ $180$. The investigation is conducted for the filter size, $n_{\rm filter}$, of $4$, $8$, and $16$. In the case of $n_{\rm filter} = 4$, the proposed method can perfectly reconstruct the fluid velocity fluctuations. The results of $n_{\rm filter} = 8$ and $16$ also exhibit substantial improvements in the fluctuation statistics although with some underestimations. Subsequently, the particle motion computed using the present method is analyzed. The trajectories, the velocity fluctuations, and the deposition velocity of particles are reconstructed accurately. Moreover, the generalizability of the present method is also demonstrated using the fields whose computational domain is larger than that used for the training. The present findings suggest that machine learning-based velocity reconstruction will enable us precise particle tracking in coarse-grid flow fields.

Abstract: Statement of problem. Dental implant geometry affects the mechanical performance and fatigue behavior of butt-joint implant-supported restorations. However, failure of the implant component has been generally studied by ignoring the prosthetic screw, which is frequently the critical restoration component Purpose. Evaluate the effect of 3 main implant geometric parameters: the implant body diameter, the platform diameter, and the implant-abutment connection type (external versus internal butt-joint) on the fatigue life of the prosthetic screw. The experimental values were further compared with the theoretical ones obtained by using a previously published methodology M&amp;M. 4 different designs of direct-to-implant dental restorations from the manufacturer BTI were tested. Forty-eight fatigue tests were performed in an axial fatigue testing machine according to ISO 14801. Linear regression models, 95% interval confidence bands for the linear regression, and 95% prediction intervals of the fatigue load-life results were obtained and compared through an analysis of covariance to determine the influence of the 3 parameters under study on the fatigue behavior Results. Linear regression models showed a statistical difference when the implant body diameter was increased by 1 mm; an average 3.5-fold increase in fatigue life was observed. Increasing the implant abutment connection diameter by 1.4 mm also showed a significant difference, leading to 7-fold longer fatigue life on average. No significant statistical evidence was found to demonstrate a difference in fatigue life between internal and external connections Conclusions. Increasing the implant platform and body diameter significantly improved the fatigue life of the screw, whereas external and internal connections provided similar results. In addition, experimental results proved the accuracy of the fatigue life prediction methodology

# Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with Chebyshev Polynomials for Fluid Mechanics

arXiv:2411.04516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is essential in scientific forecasting and fluid dynamics. Traditional approaches often incur expensive computational costs and trade-offs in efficiency and accuracy. Recent deep neural networks improve accuracy but require quality training data. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) effectively integrate physical laws, reducing data reliance in limited sample scenarios. A novel machine-learning framework, Chebyshev physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (ChebPIKAN), is proposed to integrate the robust architectures of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) with physical constraints to enhance calculation accuracy of PDEs for fluid mechanics. We explore the fundamentals of KAN, emphasis on the advantages of using the orthogonality of Chebyshev polynomial basis functions in spline fitting, and describe the incorporation of physics-informed loss functions tailored to specific PDEs in fluid dynamics, including Allen-Cahn equation, nonlinear Burgers equation, two-dimensional Helmholtz equations, two-dimensional Kovasznay flow and two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ChebPIKAN model significantly outperforms standard KAN architecture in solving various PDEs by embedding essential physical information more effectively. These results indicate that augmenting KAN with physical constraints can not only alleviate overfitting issues of KAN but also improve extrapolation performance. Consequently, this study highlights the potential of ChebPIKAN as a powerful tool in computational fluid dynamics, proposing a path toward fast and reliable predictions in fluid mechanics and beyond.

Abstract: We investigate a method to retrieve full-complex models (Transmission Matrix and Neural Network) of a highly multimode fiber (140 LP modes/polarization) using a straightforward machine learning approach, without the need of a reference beam. The models are first validated by the high fidelity between the predicted and the experimental images in the near field and far field output planes (Pearson correlation coefficient between 97.5% and 99.1% with our trained Transmission Matrix or Neural Network). Their accuracy was further confirmed by successful 3D beam shaping, a task achievable only with a true full complex model. As a prospect, we also demonstrate the ability of our neural network architecture to model nonlinear Kerr propagation in gradient index multimode fiber and predict the output beam shape.

Abstract: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is useful for overcoming the trade-off between generation speed and accuracy in the process of synthesizing computer-generated holograms (CGHs). However, methods using a CNN have limited applicability as they cannot specify the propagation distance when synthesizing a hologram. We developed a distance-adaptive CGH generator that can generate CGHs by specifying the target image and propagation distance, which comprises a zone plate encoder stage and an augmented HoloNet stage. Our model is comparable to that of prior CNN methods, with a fixed distance, in terms of performance and achieves the generation accuracy and speed necessary for practical use.

For the first time, we unprecedentedly reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss, high precision, high-efficiency modulation, high stability quasi-continuity and reconfigurability. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical switching. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.

# HypoNet Nankai: Rapid hypocenter determination tool for the Nankai Trough subduction zone using physics-informed neural networks

## HypoNet Nankai: 使用物理信息神经网络的南开海槽俯冲带快速震源确定工具

Abstract: Accurate hypocenter determination in the Nankai Trough subduction zone is essential for hazard assessment and advancing our understanding of seismic activity in the region. A handy hypocenter determination tool incorporating a realistic 3D velocity structure, accessible to the scientific community, is beneficial. In this study, we developed HypoNet Nankai, a rapid hypocenter determination tool based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) emulator (surrogate model) for travel time calculations. This tool leverages a PINN trained to predict P-wave travel times between arbitrary underground sources and surface receivers with a realistic 3D P-wave velocity structure model of the Nankai Trough subduction zone that incorporates marine seismic survey data. The PINN embeds physical laws, namely, the Eikonal equation, directly into the loss function of training and circumvents the need for labeled training data. To address the training challenges posed by small-scale features in the velocity model, we employed a simple domain decomposition approach and Fourier feature embedding. Once trained, the PINN immediately infers the P-wave travel time, enabling rapid hypocenter determination. The data size required to store NNs for travel time calculations is significantly smaller than those of conventional travel-time tables. HypoNet Nankai provides high flexibility for addition of new observation points. We verified HypoNet Nankai by comparing its performance with a widely used grid-based numerical method for forward travel time calculations and synthetic hypocenter determination. In both tests, HypoNet Nankai provided results consistent with those for the conventional method. HypoNet Nankai offers a rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use hypocenter determination method for the Nankai Trough subduction zone, with greater data efficiency and extendibility compared to conventional approaches.

# Diabatic states of charge transfer with constrained charge equilibration

## 具有受限电荷平衡的非绝热电荷转移状态

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04807

arXiv:2411.04807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge transfer (CT) processes that are electronically non-adiabatic are ubiquitous in chemistry, biology, and materials science, but their theoretical description requires diabatic states or adiabatic excited states. For complex systems, these latter states are more difficult to calculate than the adiabatic ground state. Here, we propose a simple method to obtain diabatic states, including energies and charges, by constraining the atomic charges within the charge equilibration framework. For two-state systems, the exact diabatic coupling can be determined, from which the adiabatic excited-state energy can also be calculated. The method can be viewed as an affordable alternative to constrained density functional theory (CDFT), and so we call it constrained charge equilibration (CQEq). We test the CQEq method on the anthracene-tetracyanoethylene CT complex and the reductive decomposition of ethylene carbonate on a lithium metal surface. We find that CQEq predicts diabatic energies, charges, and adiabatic excitation energies in good agreement with CDFT, and we propose that CQEq is promising for combination with machine learning force fields to study non-adiabatic CT in the condensed phase.

# Harnessing the Power of Gradient-Based Simulations for Multi-Objective Optimization in Particle Accelerators

## 利用基于梯度的模拟的力量在粒子加速器中进行多目标优化

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04817

arXiv:2411.04817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle accelerator operation requires simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives. Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is particularly challenging due to trade-offs between the objectives. Evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA), have been leveraged for many optimization problems, however, they do not apply to complex control problems by design. This paper demonstrates the power of differentiability for solving MOO problems using a Deep Differentiable Reinforcement Learning (DDRL) algorithm in particle accelerators. We compare DDRL algorithm with Model Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL), GA and Bayesian Optimization (BO) for simultaneous optimization of heat load and trip rates in the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF). The underlying problem enforces strict constraints on both individual states and actions as well as cumulative (global) constraint for energy requirements of the beam. A physics-based surrogate model based on real data is developed. This surrogate model is differentiable and allows back-propagation of gradients. The results are evaluated in the form of a Pareto-front for two objectives. We show that the DDRL outperforms MFRL, BO, and GA on high dimensional problems.

# Single replica spin-glass phase detection using field variation and machine learning

## 使用场变化和机器学习的单副本自旋玻璃相位检测

arXiv:2411.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model used the replica symmetry method to find the phase transition of the system. In 1979-1980, Parisi proposed a solution based on replica symmetry breaking (RSB), which allowed him to identify the underlying phases of complex systems such as spin-glasses. Regardless of the method used for detection, the intrinsic phase of a system exists whether or not replicas are considered. We introduce a single replica method of spin-glass phase detection using the field's variation experienced by each spin in a system configuration. This method focuses on a single replica with quenched random couplings. Each spin inevitably observes a different field from the others. Our results show that the mean and variance of fields named "Spontaneous Configurational Field" experienced by spins are suitable indicators to explore different ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and mixed phases. To classify different phases of the system with defined indicators we have developed an algorithm based on machine learning to analyze the desired samples.

# Quantum adiabatic optimization with Rydberg arrays: localization phenomena and encoding strategies

## 使用Rydberg阵列进行量子绝热优化: 定位现象和编码策略

arXiv:2411.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of the encoding scheme proposed in [Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023)], which encodes optimization problems on graphs with arbitrary connectivity into Rydberg atom arrays. Here, a graph vertex is represented by a wire of atoms, and the (crossing) crossing-with-edge gadget is placed at the intersection of two wires to (de)couple their degrees of freedom and reproduce the graph connectivity. We consider the fundamental geometry of two vertex-wires intersecting via a single gadget and look at minimum gap scaling with system size along adiabatic protocols. We find that both polynomial and exponential scaling are possible and, by means of perturbation theory, we relate the exponential closing of the minimum gap to an unfavorable localization of the ground-state wavefunction. Then, on the QuEra Aquila neutral atom machine, we observe such localization and its effect on the success probability of finding the correct solution to the encoded optimization problem. Finally, we propose possible strategies to avoid this quantum bottleneck, leading to an exponential improvement in the adiabatic performance.

arXiv:2411.04681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to truly understand how social media might shape online discourses or contribute to societal polarization, we need refined models of platform choice, that is: models that help us understand why users prefer one social media platform over another. This study develops a dynamic model of platform selection, extending Social Feedback Theory by incorporating multi-agent reinforcement learning to capture how user decisions are shaped by past rewards across different platforms. A key parameter ($\mu$) in the model governs users' tendencies to either seek approval from like-minded peers or engage with opposing views. Our findings reveal that online environments can evolve into suboptimal states characterized by polarized, strongly opinionated echo chambers, even when users prefer diverse perspectives. Interestingly, this polarizing state coexists with another equilibrium, where users gravitate toward a single dominant platform, marginalizing other platforms into extremity. Using agent-based simulations and dynamical systems analysis, our model underscores the complex interplay of user preferences and platform dynamics, offering insights into how digital spaces might be better managed to foster diverse discourse.

# Insight into the effect of force error on the thermal conductivity from machine-learned potentials

## 从机器学习的电位洞察力误差对热导率的影响

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04769

arXiv:2411.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have been extensively used to obtain the lattice thermal conductivity via atomistic simulations. However, the impact of force errors in various MLPs on thermal transport has not been widely recognized and remains to be fully understood. Here, we employ MLP-driven molecular dynamics (MD) and anharmonic lattice dynamics (LD) to systematically investigate how the calculated thermal conductivity varies with the force errors, using boron arsenide as a prototypical material. We consistently observe an underestimation of thermal conductivity in MD simulations with three different MLPs including the neuroevolution potential, deep potential, and moment tensor potential. We provide a robust extrapolation scheme based on controlled force noises via the Langevin thermostat to correct this underestimation. The corrected results achieve a good agreement with previous experimental measurement from 200 K to 600 K. In contrast, the thermal conductivity values from LD calculations with MLPs readily align with the experimental data, which is attributed to the much smaller effects of the force errors on the force-constant calculations.

arXiv:2406.08506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models hold great promise for small molecule discovery, significantly increasing the size of search space compared to traditional in silico screening libraries. However, most existing machine learning methods for small molecule generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate compounds, making experimental validation difficult. In this paper we propose Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the GFlowNet framework that operates directly in the space of chemical reactions, thereby allowing out-of-the-box synthesizability while maintaining comparable quality of generated candidates. We demonstrate that with the proposed set of reactions and building blocks, it is possible to obtain a search space of molecules orders of magnitude larger than existing screening libraries coupled with low cost of synthesis. We also show that the approach scales to very large fragment libraries, further increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including pretrained proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking.

# Large Airfoil Models

arXiv:2410.08392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of a "Large Airfoil Model (LAM)," a transformative approach for answering technical questions on airfoil aerodynamics, requires a vast dataset and a model to leverage it. To build this foundation, a novel probabilistic machine learning approach, A Deep Airfoil Prediction Tool (ADAPT), has been developed. ADAPT makes uncertainty-aware predictions of airfoil pressure coefficient ($C_p$) distributions by harnessing experimental data and incorporating measurement uncertainties. By employing deep kernel learning, performing Gaussian Process Regression in a ten-dimensional latent space learned by a neural network, ADAPT effectively handles unstructured experimental datasets. In tandem, Airfoil Surface Pressure Information Repository of Experiments (ASPIRE), the first large-scale, open-source repository of airfoil experimental data has been developed. ASPIRE integrates century-old historical data with modern reports, forming an unparalleled resource of real-world pressure measurements. This addresses a critical gap left by prior repositories, which relied primarily on numerical simulations. Demonstrative results for three airfoils show that ADAPT accurately predicts $C_p$ distributions and aerodynamic coefficients across varied flow conditions, achieving a mean absolute error in enclosed area ($\text{MAE}_\text{enclosed}$) of 0.029. ASPIRE and ADAPT lay the foundation for a future, more elaborate LAM that is coupled with a large language model, which will then enable users to perform design tasks based on design questions rather than explicit technical inputs.

Abstract: Despite an artificial intelligence-assisted modeling of disordered crystals is a widely used and well-tried method of new materials design, the issues of its robustness, reliability, and stability are still not resolved and even not discussed enough. To highlight it, in this work we composed a series of nested intermetallic approximants of quasicrystals datasets and trained various machine learning models on them correspondingly. Our qualitative and, what is more important, quantitative assessment of the difference in the predictions clearly shows that different reasonable changes in the training sample can lead to the completely different set of the predicted potentially new materials. We also showed the advantage of pre-training and proposed a simple yet effective trick of sequential training to increase stability.

# Representing Domain-Mixing Optical Degradation for Real-World Computational Aberration Correction via Vector Quantization

arXiv:2403.10012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relying on paired synthetic data, existing learning-based Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) methods are confronted with the intricate and multifaceted synthetic-to-real domain gap, which leads to suboptimal performance in real-world applications. In this paper, in contrast to improving the simulation pipeline, we deliver a novel insight into real-world CAC from the perspective of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). By incorporating readily accessible unpaired real-world data into training, we formalize the Domain Adaptive CAC (DACAC) task, and then introduce a comprehensive Real-world aberrated images (Realab) dataset to benchmark it. The setup task presents a formidable challenge due to the intricacy of understanding the target optical degradation domain. To this intent, we propose a novel Quantized Domain-Mixing Representation (QDMR) framework as a potent solution to the issue. Centering around representing and quantizing the optical degradation which is consistent across different images, QDMR adapts the CAC model to the target domain from three key aspects: (1) reconstructing aberrated images of both domains by a VQGAN to learn a Domain-Mixing Codebook (DMC) characterizing the optical degradation; (2) modulating the deep features in CAC model with DMC to transfer the target domain knowledge; and (3) leveraging the trained VQGAN to generate pseudo target aberrated images from the source ones for convincing target domain supervision. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks reveal that the models with QDMR consistently surpass the competitive methods in mitigating the synthetic-to-real gap, which produces visually pleasant real-world CAC results with fewer artifacts. Codes and datasets are made publicly available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/QDMR.

# Navigating Chemical Space with Latent Flows

arXiv:2405.03987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress of deep generative models in the vision and language domain has stimulated significant interest in more structured data generation such as molecules. However, beyond generating new random molecules, efficient exploration and a comprehensive understanding of the vast chemical space are of great importance to molecular science and applications in drug design and materials discovery. In this paper, we propose a new framework, ChemFlow, to traverse chemical space through navigating the latent space learned by molecule generative models through flows. We introduce a dynamical system perspective that formulates the problem as learning a vector field that transports the mass of the molecular distribution to the region with desired molecular properties or structure diversity. Under this framework, we unify previous approaches on molecule latent space traversal and optimization and propose alternative competing methods incorporating different physical priors. We validate the efficacy of ChemFlow on molecule manipulation and single- and multi-objective molecule optimization tasks under both supervised and unsupervised molecular discovery settings. Codes and demos are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/garywei944/ChemFlow.

# Adaptive energy reference for machine-learning models of the electronic density of states

## 电子态密度机器学习模型的自适应能量参考

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01068

arXiv:2407.01068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) provides information regarding the distribution of electronic energy levels in a material, and can be used to approximate its optical and electronic properties and therefore guide computational material design. Given its usefulness and relative simplicity, it has been one of the first electronic properties used as target for machine-learning approaches going beyond interatomic potentials. A subtle but important point, well-appreciated in the condensed matter community but usually overlooked in the construction of data-driven models, is that for bulk configurations the absolute energy reference of single-particle energy levels is ill-defined. Only energy differences matter, and quantities derived from the DOS are typically independent on the absolute alignment. We introduce an adaptive scheme that optimizes the energy reference of each structure as part of the training process, and show that it consistently improves the quality of ML models compared to traditional choices of energy reference, for different classes of materials and different model architectures. On a practical level, we trace the improved performance to the ability of this self-aligning scheme to match the most prominent features in the DOS. More broadly, we believe that this work highlights the importance of incorporating insights into the nature of the physical target into the definition of the architecture and of the appropriate figures of merit for machine-learning models, that translate in better transferability and overall performance.

# Odor Classification: Exploring Feature Performance and Imbalanced Data Learning Techniques

## 气味分类: 探索特征性能和不平衡数据学习技术

This research delves into olfaction, a sensory modality that remains complex and inadequately understood. We aim to fill in two gaps in recent studies that attempted to use machine learning and deep learning approaches to predict human smell perception. The first one is that molecules are usually represented with molecular fingerprints, mass spectra, and vibrational spectra; however, the influence of the selected representation method on predictive performance is inadequately documented in direct comparative studies. To fill this gap, we assembled a large novel dataset of 2606 molecules with three kinds of features: mass spectra (MS), vibrational spectra (VS) and molecular fingerprint features (FP). We evaluated their performance using four different multi-label classification models. The second objective is to address an inherent challenge in odor classification multi-label datasets (MLD)—the issue of class imbalance by random resampling techniques and an explainable, cost-sensitive multilayer perceptron model (CSMLP). Experimental results suggest significantly better performance of the molecular fingerprint-based features compared with mass and vibrational spectra with the micro-averaged F1 evaluation metric. The proposed resampling techniques and cost-sensitive model outperform the results of previous studies. We also report the predictive performance of multimodal features obtained by fusing the three mentioned features. This comprehensive and systematic study compares the predictive performance for odor classification of different features and utilises a multifaceted approach to deal with data imbalance. Our explainable model sheds further light on features and odour relations. The results hold the potential to guide the development of the electric nose and our dataset will be made publicly available.

The neurodegenerative illness Alzheimer's disease causes 70% of cases of dementia, leading to the impairment of behavioral and cognitive functions such as language, attention, memory, judgment, and reasoning. The disease is caused by the buildup of amyloid fibrils in brain neurons. Recently, in 2023, a new type of amyloid fibril extracted from the leptomeninges of Alzheimer’s disease patients has been resolved. This structure has a different shape and size than the earlier 2019 structure. We hypothesize that since the two structures are different, the ligands binding and inhibiting the structure should also be different. Therefore, a rigorous research process was undertaken, including molecular docking simulations to identify inhibitors that can bind at the fibril interface and prevent fibril formation. A total of 8216 ligands were docked on the amyloid protein, and the best five ligands based on the binding interactions were selected for further evaluation. These results were further validated using a machine-learning technique called P2Rank. Finally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations in the protein-fibril complex were performed to understand the interactions between amyloid peptide/fibril and the plasma membrane. The thoroughness of our research process instills confidence in the potential of developing inhibitors that can prevent fibril formation, potentially leading to new treatments for the disease.

The tunable structure of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is an ideal platform to achieve contradictory requirements for proton exchange membranes, a key component of fuel cells. However, the rational design of proton-conducting MOFs remains a challenge owing to the intricate structure-property relationships that govern the target performance. In the present study, the modeling of quantities available for hundreds of MOFs is scaled up to many thousands of entities using supervised machine learning. The experimental dataset was curated to train multimodal transformer-based networks, which integrated crystal graph, energy-grid, and global-state embeddings. Uncertainty-aware models reveal superprotonic conductors among synthesized MOFs that have not been previously investigated for the considered application, highlighting magnesium-containing frameworks with aliphatic linkers as high-confidence candidates for experimental validation. Furthermore, classifiers trained on the activation energy threshold effectively discriminated between well-known proton-conduction mechanisms, providing physical insights beyond black-box routine. Our findings have proved a great potential for the data-driven materials design, which becomes a valuable addition to experimental studies devoted to proton-conducting MOFs.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) plays a key role for the analysis of a plethora of molecules, including natural products and drug-like organic molecules. For such cases 1H NMR spectra have proven imperative because of their high sensitivity. However, these spectra are complicated by complex multiplet patterns that, although important for the analysis, lead to substantial overlap. Here we show a deep-learning approach, which transforms spin-echo modulated 1H NMR spectra into highly sensitive and high-resolution singlet NMR spectra, that is, virtual homonuclear decoupled pure shift spectra. The approach was evaluated on experimental NMR spectra of complex organic compounds, where it outperforms current methods. The method also predicts uncertainties of the transformation and therefore allows for quantifications. We believe that our approach will provide significant advantages when characterizing low sensitivity samples, where no signals are observed in traditional pure-shift spectra and strong overlaps are hampering analysis from conventional spectra.

The preferred structures of lithium halides (LiX, with X = Cl, Br, I) in organic solvents have been the subject of a wide scientific debate, and a large variety of forms has been isolated and characterized by X-ray diffraction. The identified molecular scaffolds for LiX are diverse, often built on (LiX)n rings with a prevalence of rhomboidal arrangements and an appropriate number of solvent or Lewis base molecules coordinating the lithium ions. Much less is known about the structures of LiX in solution, limiting the understanding of the synergistic role of LiX in reactions with various organometallic complexes, as prominently represented by the turbo Grignard reaction. Here, we trained a machine learning potential on ab initio data to explore the complex conformational landscape for systems comprising 4 LiX moieties in tetrahydrofuran (THF). For all the considered halogens a large number of scaffolds were found at thermally accessible free energy values, indicating that LiX in solution are a diverse ensemble constituted by (LiX)n moieties of various size, completed by the appropriate number of coordinating THF. LiCl shows preference for compact, pseudo-cubane [(LiCl)(THF)]4 structures, coexisting with open rings. At concen- trations close to the solubility limit, LiCl forms hexagonal structures, in analogy with literature observations on pre-nucleating NaCl. LiBr tends to favor less compact, more solvated aggregates. LiI significantly differs from the two other cases, producing highly solvated, monomeric, dimeric or linear structures. This study provides a comprehensive view of LiX in organic solvent, revealing dynamical polymorphism that is not easily experimentally observable.

Molecular generation models, especially chemical language model (CLM) utilizing SMILES, a string representation of compounds, face limitations in handling large and complex compounds while maintaining structural accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose FRATTVAE, a Transformer-based variational autoencoder that treats molecules as tree structures with fragments as nodes. FRATTVAE employs several innovative deep learning techniques, including ECFP (Extended Connectivity Fingerprints) based token embeddings and the Transformer’s self-attention mechanism, FRATTVAE efficiently handles large-scale compounds, improving both computational speed and generation accuracy. Evaluations across benchmark datasets, ranging from small molecules to natural compounds, demonstrate that FRATTVAE consistently outperforms existing models, achieving superior reconstruction accuracy and generation quality. Additionally, in molecular optimization tasks, FRATTVAE generated stable, high-quality molecules with desired properties, avoiding structural alerts. These results highlight FRATTVAE as a robust and versatile solution for molecular generation and optimization, making it well-suited for a variety of applications in cheminformatics and drug discovery.

## 有机合成中路线评分的专家增强深度学习方法

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-tp7rh?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

The selection of efficient multi-step synthesis routes is a fundamental challenge in organic synthesis. Comparing different routes involves numerous parameters, economic considerations, and the integration of nuanced chemical knowledge. While computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) tools can generate synthetic routes, evaluating their overall feasibility and quality continues to rely heavily on human expertise, often lacking consistency and reproducibility. To address this, we have developed a data-driven scoring model that incorporates significant human input. Experts selected key synthesis aspects to score and determined the most representative features of chemical knowledge. The model produces target-specific, generalizable scores for synthetic routes, achieving a top-1 ranking accuracy of 60 \% when benchmarked against experimental data. Evaluation bins, defined by human experts, were incorporated into the final score alongside route length, ensuring a comprehensive assessment. We demonstrate that this criterion and the resulting route rankings align with expert judgment and synthesis feasibility, learned from published reaction data.

Our study focused on the implementation and testing of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) into the AMBER software suite. This implementation enables us to perform a novel type of molecular dynamics simulation utilizing the hybrid machine learning/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) potentials. To underpin the capabilities of ML/MM simulations, we first validated our implementation at a fundamental physical level by confirming energy and momentum conservation laws. The successful validation indicates that our implementation is able to produce adequate and physically interpretable samplings. Building upon this, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we proposed an ML/MM-compatible thermodynamic integration (TI) protocol to tackle real-world challenges, such as solvation free energy calculation. Our results demonstrate that this computational protocol can predict hydration free energies with an accuracy of less than 1.00 kcal/mol compared to experimental data, paving the way for the use of ML/MM in multiscale simulations to addressing future drug design problems. Moreover, by applying ML/MM in molecular dynamics simulations of protein-ligand complexes, we demonstrated that the adequate samplings enable us to accurately reproduce experimental binding free energies. Thus, our implementation can offer new insights into biomolecular systems using the ML/MM "microscope". Last, we demonstrated that our implementation can achieve nanosecond timescale simulations daily after significant effort being put to improve the code performance. In a conclusion, we have successfully implemented ML/MM potential to AMBER software package after overcoming limitations in current multi-scale simulations including low computational efficiency. We have advanced TI theory allowing us to accurately predict free energies with ML/MM potentials.

Two-dimensional (2D) layered metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs) are gaining attention due to their unique
structural and electronic properties with promising applications in compact electronic device fabrication. Long-time and large-scale molecular dynamics simulation of these materials can enhance and expedite the mapping out of their structure-property-function relationships for these applications. To make such simulations more feasible, herein, we construct a high-dimensional committee neural network potential (CNNP) for archetypal 2D MOFs Ni3(HIB)2 and Ni3(HITP)2 where HIB=hexaiminobenzene and HITP=hexaiminotriphenylene. We harness the power of active learning and committee neural networks to obtain a CNNP model using only hundreds of snapshots from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories. The developed CNNP models allow for simulations of
thousands of atoms over extended timescales, which is typically unfeasible with AIMD simulations, while maintaining the accuracy of the reference data. Our stable MD simulations based on the developed CNNP model reveal the flexible nature of the studied 2D MOFs at room temperature, including puckered layers, as opposed to the planar ones from 0 K electronic structure calculations. Furthermore, our model demonstrates transferability between bulk and monolayers, as well as different
organic linkers. As the first model of its kind, we show that
the high-dimensional CNNP models could be a reliable and
effective approach for future studies on 2D MOFs.

Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a potent tool for identifying molecular structures and studying the chemical properties of compounds, and hence, various theoretical approaches have been developed to simulate and predict the IR spectra. However, the theoretical approaches based on quantum chemical calculations suffer from high computational cost (e.g., density functional theory, DFT) or insufficient accuracy (e.g., semi-empirical methods orders of magnitude faster than DFT). Here, we introduce a new approach, based on the universal machine learning (ML) models of the AIQM series targeting CCSD(T)/CBS level, that can deliver molecular IR spectra with accuracy close to DFT (compared to the experiment) and the speed close to a semi-empirical GFN2-xTB method. This approach enables efficient interpretation of the IR bands by clearly assigning them to the vibrational normal modes in contrast to alternative ML models, which can only predict the spectra. Our implementations for calculating IR spectra with ML and quantum mechanical (DFT, semi-empirical, ab initio wavefunction) approaches are available in MLatom as described in https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom.

# Machine Learning in Healthcare Citizen Science: A Scoping Review

## 医疗保健公民科学中的机器学习: 范围研究综述

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5405336/latest

Objectives: This scoping review aims to clarify the definition and trajectory of citizen-led scientific research (so-called citizen science) within the healthcare domain, examine the degree of integration of machine learning (ML) and the participation levels of citizen scientists in health-related projects.
Materials and Methods: In January and September 2024 we conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost platform for peer-reviewed publications that combine citizen science and machine learning (ML) in healthcare. Articles were excluded if citizens were merely passive data providers or if only professional scientists were involved.
Results: Out of an initial 1,395 screened, 56 articles spanning from 2013 to 2024 met the inclusion criteria. The majority of research projects were conducted in the U.S. (n=20, 35.7%), followed by Germany (n=6, 10.7%), with Spain, Canada, and the UK each contributing three studies (5.4%). Data collection was the primary form of citizen scientist involvement (n=29, 51.8%), which included capturing images, sharing data online, and mailing samples. Data annotation was the next most common activity (n=15, 26.8%), followed by participation in ML model challenges (n=8, 14.3%) and decision-making contributions (n=3, 5.4%). Mosquitoes (n=10, 34.5%) and air pollution samples (n=7, 24.2%) were the main data objects collected by citizens for ML analysis. Classification tasks were the most prevalent ML method (n=30, 52.6%), with Convolutional Neural Networks being the most frequently used algorithm (n=13, 20%).
Discussion and Conclusions: &amp;nbsp;Citizen science in healthcare is currently an American and European construct with growing expansion in Asia. Citizens are contributing data, and labeling data for ML methods, but only infrequently analyzing or leading studies. Projects that use &ldquo;crowd-sourced&rdquo; data and &ldquo;citizen science&rdquo; should be differentiated depending on the degree of involvement of citizens.

# Wide-row cereal cultivation as a tool to promote brown hare (Lepus europaeus) populations: a performance assessment

## 宽行谷物种植作为促进褐兔 (Lepus europaeus) 种群的工具: 绩效评估

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5347073/latest

For pre-weaning leverets (Lepus europaeus), cereals are low risk crops because predators rarely hunt there and agricultural machinery is only used once during the harvest. However, the dense stand of cereals hinders hares to enter from May until harvest in July, the months with the highest numbers of leverets. Making cereal fields accessible to hares in spring and summer by sewing them in wider rows than usual may improve the survival of young hares and thus could increase hare populations. Here, we assessed the impact of a recent change in cereal cultivation that has been introduced in Switzerland specifically to promote brown hares: the cultivation of cereals in wide rows. We surveyed hare densities between spring and autumn and assessed whether the seasonal increase in density (i.e. the hare population growth rate) depended on the proportion of cereals in wide rows, arable land, cereals and fallow land as well as on hare density in spring using mixed linear models. A total of 32 study areas with an average size of 376 ha were surveyed. Of the four land-use variables, only the proportion of cereals in wide rows had a significant positive effect (p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.02) on the hare population growth rate. A 1% increase in cereals in wide rows results in an average increase in hare growth rate of 3.6%. This effect was weaker in areas with a high hare density in spring. We conclude that cereals in wide rows is a useful tool to increase brown hare densities.

# Zero-Shot LLM-based Visual Acuity Extraction: A Pilot Study

## 基于零拍LLM的视力提取: 一项初步研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5287278/latest

Introduction Visual acuity (VA) and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements are crucial indicators of ocular health. However, the documentation of these vital parameters in clinical notes often lacks standardisation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using of large language models (LLMs) for automated extraction of VA and IOP data from unstructured ophthalmology clinic notes.Method Outpatient clinic notes from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Ophthalmology department were analysed using a 70&amp;nbsp;billion parameter LLaMA-3 model in a zero-shot learning approach. Nine data points per eye were extracted, including various VA measurements, IOP, and measurement methods. Results were compared to expert-verified ground truth data.Results Sixty-nine outpatient clinic notes were collected. Locally deployed LLM analysis of clinic notes was feasible. High accuracy was observed in extracting best corrected VA and IOP (above 90% for both eyes). Performance varied for other measurements, with lower accuracy for uncorrected VA (67&amp;ndash;75%) and challenges in interpreting ambiguous documentation. The model struggled to identify assumed uncorrected VA cases, highlighting issues which may correlate with documentation clarity.Conclusion This study has demonstrated that it is feasible to deploy a LLM locally to extract VA data from free-text notes. However, the accuracy of extracted data was lacking in several domains. These performance issues highlight that further research is required to optimise the accuracy of the retrieved data.

# Application of EOS based on machine learning method on CFD study of rapid hydrogen refueling process

## 基于机器学习方法的EOS在快速加氢过程CFD研究中的应用

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5012331/latest

Currently, commercially operated hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FECVs) store hydrogen as highly compressed gas form to increase volumetric energy density. To provide a refueling time similar to that of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) should supply gaseous hydrogen into FECVs up to high pressure (35 MPa or 70 MPa) in a relatively short time. The refueling process of rapidly filling compressed gas within a confined volume of the storage tank is inevitably accompanied by an increase in temperature. However, the refueling process should be carried out under limited conditions considering the physical safety of the storage tank. Modeling the refueling process under the theoretical basis is useful for understanding the gas filling phenomenon and finding the optimal refueling strategy. In particular, the CFD research method which considers the flow of fluid in a tank offers the local temperature changes inside a storage tank as well as the average temperature. The CFD research is conducted by combining a model representing the fluid properties and a model describing the flow characteristics. Therefore, an appropriate combination of models should be examined before simulating the refueling process of an actual FECVs that requires time and cost that cannot be overlooked. In this study, the hydrogen refueling process is simulated using three equations of state (EOSs) and five turbulent models and, then, the results are compared and quantitively analyzed using experimental data. Experiments of filling type III tank of 74 L up to 35 MPa within 1 min have been chosen to make the assumption of axial symmetry for CFD model valid. Comparing the three EOSs (SRK, PR, ML), it is found that it is possible to improve accuracy and reduce calculation time when using ML EOS which has been developed to describe the behavior of hydrogen. Among the five turbulence models (yPlus, k-&epsilon;, realizable k-&epsilon;, low Reynolds k-&epsilon;, and k-&omega;) generally used in CFD research, the k-&epsilon; and the realizable k-&epsilon; model show satisfactory results on the reproduction of mean and local thermal behaviors and calculation time.

# Practical Implementation of Discrete Wavelet Transform-based Sensing using Software Defined Radio

## 基于软件无线电的离散小波变换传感的实际实现

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5344204/latest

Spectrum sensing techniques are vital in both spectrum utilization and spectrum scarcity solutions. This paper proposes a wide band spectrum sensing method using discrete wavelet transform with Daubechies4 function to distinguish between the primary user spectrum and white spaces. The proposed model is validated through simulation using LabVIEW NXG software. Then, it is practically implemented in real-time and in a real environment using a universal software-defined radio peripheral (USRP) platform, which is a software-defined radio (SDR) at 2 GHz radio frequency. Long-short-term memory (LSTM), a deep learning approach, is used to evaluate the system's performance. Simulation and practical results show the system's efficiency in terms of the probability of detection in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Furthermore, the proposed LSTM network achieves 99% classification accuracy.

# Explainable machine learning for groundwater contamination by arsenic remobilization from a vadose zone

## 可解释的机器学习通过从渗流区中清除砷来污染地下水

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5309217/latest

The vadose zone serves as a barrier retaining arsenic (As) from reaching groundwater. However, previous studies revealed that retained As can be remobilized from vadose zone under wet&amp;ndash;dry cycles, increasing contamination risks. This study quantified As remobilization and developed a predictive model using soil properties. Twenty-two unsaturated soil columns with varying characteristics underwent wet-dry cycles after As retention, resulting in remobilization of 13.9&amp;ndash;150.6 mg/kg of As (37.0&amp;ndash;74.6% of retained As). A random forest model was established to predict As remobilization using soil properties, including organic matter (OM) content, iron (Fe) content, uniformity coefficient, D30 (particle diameter at which 30% by weight of soil is finer), and bulk density. Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analyses revealed that D30, inter-related with Fe content, exhibited the highest contribution to As remobilization, followed by OM content, partially mediated by bulk density, offering insights into groundwater contamination risks under fluctuating meteorological conditions.

# Educational Escape Rooms for Raising Information Privacy Competences: An Empirical Validation

## 提高信息隐私能力的教育逃生室: 实证验证

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5277322/latest

Contemporary research has highlighted the need to specify the competences that individuals need to possess in order to protect their privacy against the potential risks of the internet, beyond mere awareness. The reassessment of conventional strategies for enhancing knowledge and skills for privacy protection has directed research attention towards the design and development of innovative educational interventions. To address this gap, in this paper we explore the effectiveness of educational escape rooms in enhancing users' privacy competencies. The study experimentally tested a 2D digital escape room which we designed to improve five specific privacy skills among 81 adult participants. The empirical findings show significant improvement in all the competencies tested: the ability to install and customize safeguards, the ability to perceive privacy risk, self-control, the ability to perceive privacy and privacy concerns. This demonstrates the potential of escape rooms as innovative tools for privacy learning, suggesting implications for designers of educational games and privacy software. This investigation contributes novel insights into privacy education by being one of the first studies to implement and test a privacy-focused escape room.

# Changes in chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment in gastrointestinal cancer survivors using multidomain assessments: a prospective cohort study

## 使用多域评估的胃肠道癌症幸存者中化疗引起的认知障碍的变化: 一项前瞻性队列研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5191114/latest

Purpose: Risk factors for cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) are diverse; neuroimaging instruments are recommended to complement subjective and objective cognitive assessments. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a multidomain assessment protocol for CRCI in gastrointestinal cancer survivors.
Methods: Twenty-four patients with gastrointestinal cancer scheduled for chemotherapy and 24 healthy controls were recruited. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-cognitive function (FACT-Cog) was used to assess subjective cognitive functions. Objective cognitive function was assessed using the trail-making test, auditory verbal learning test (AVLT), and verbal fluency test. Cerebral hemodynamic changes in the prefrontal cortex were measured using portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (P-NIRS). Assessments were conducted at baseline and six-month follow-up.
Results: Thirty-eight participants were included in the analysis. There was a statistically significant difference in AVLT-delayed recall (p=0.002) in the chemotherapy group compared with the healthy control group, &amp;nbsp;but no significant difference in either group for other cognitive assessments. The chemotherapy group exhibited reduced activity in the left frontal pole at six months post-treatment compared to baseline (p=0.018).
Conclusions: Gastrointestinal cancer survivors who receive chemotherapy may exhibit poorer delayed recall of memory functions than healthy individuals. Monitoring prefrontal cortical hemodynamics using P-NIRS during cognitive tasks is feasible for clinical application and understanding CRCI symptoms.
Implications for Cancer Survivors: This multidomain assessments ars translatable to clinical practice and useful for other cancers. Furthermore, It can lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of depressive symptoms and declining motivation on the cognitive function of cancer survivors.

# Multifunctional PVA/PNIPAM conductive hydrogel sensors enabled Human-Machine interaction intelligent rehabilitation training

## 多功能PVA/PNIPAM导电水凝胶传感器实现人机交互智能康复训练

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5092985/latest

Hydrogels are regarded as an ideal medium for human-machine interaction (HMI) due to their adjustable modulus and flexibility, enabling seamless interaction with smart devices. However, in the field of medical rehabilitation, most of the hydrogel-based sensors are simply used to detect the motion signals of fragments and are rarely applied to help patients with rehabilitation training and improve the efficiency of doctors' diagnosis. This is due to the unstable sensing properties and poor mechanical properties of most hydrogels. The poor durability greatly limits the application of hydrogel-based sensors. Here, a conductive hydrogel sensor with visual temperature sensitivity and good mechanical properties (300% strain, breaking stress 0.19 MPa) is fabricated by introducing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-borax system combined with a freeze-thaw physical regulation strategy. The PVA/PNIPAM/PEDOT: PSS (PPP) hydrogels possess a rapid response/recovery time (200 ms/200 ms), a low detection limit of 1% strain, and good stability and durability. Furthermore, by integrating the hydrogels with a LabVIEW circuit program and wireless transmission technology, we have developed an advanced intelligent HMI system capable of monitoring, rehabilitation training, and remote diagnosis.

# Effective oral cytology deep learning classifier for annotation labels with diagnostic differences

## 有效的口腔细胞学深度学习分类器，用于具有诊断差异的注释标签

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5159465/latest

Oral cytological diagnosis is challenging and often leads to differing diagnostic outcomes. Recently, diagnostic technologies for medical images using artificial intelligence (AI) have advanced significantly. However, these advancements typically apply to cases where AI training data are uniform, leaving the effectiveness of AI models with differing correct labels unclear. This study reports on the exploration of the most effective AI model for varying labels in oral cytology images, and evaluation of classification prediction impacts when less experienced physician models are incorporated. In this study, the deep learning model ResNet50 was used, and we constructed single (individual pathologist, majority voting, and probabilistic models) and multiple models (head-fusion and logit-fusion). We also assessed the impact of less-experienced physician models on AI diagnostic performance. Among the single models, the probabilistic model was the most stable, whereas the head-fusion model among multiple models achieved the highest classification accuracy. Additionally, the head-fusion model minimized the influence of the less-experienced physician models and the probabilistic model exhibited a statistically significant decline in performance. In AI diagnosis with various correct labels, the head-fusion model proved to be the most robust and effective, suggesting that applying appropriate weightings can enhance learning and improve diagnostic accuracy.

# Utilizing Sophisticated Lattice Support Structures in Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing

## 在电子束增材制造中利用复杂的晶格支撑结构

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5130285/latest

Additive Manufacturing of complex parts with overhangs using Electron Beam melting (EBM) frequently need additional sacrificial support structures to support the part during the process. In order to prevent deformation or bending due to thermal loads, these structures, which are constructed concurrently with the part, secure the overhang geometry to the base plate. The design and choice of support structure can affect the cost and time of manufacturing, the ability to manufacture complicated metal parts, and the effective use of materials and energy. This study advances the design and production of a more effective support by utilizing lattice structures with a relatively minimal volume fraction. This work aims to use lattice structures as supports for parts production in EBM. It evaluates the effects of metal lattice support structure parameters on support structure removal and overhang quality (overhang distortion). Two types of lattice structures, Diamond and Dode-thin, have been selected and assessed using varying beam current, scan speed, lattice cell size, and process parameters. The specimens are fabricated using EBM, wire electric discharge machine is used to remove the support structures and 3D comparison technique is used to evaluate the overhang distortion. The findings indicate that the lattice structures function effectively as support structures, and the design and process parameters have an effect on the performance of the generated support; however, these effects were not substantial.

# A Novel Approach Data Security in Cloud Using Authenticationwith Blockchain Authorization

## 一种基于区块链授权的云数据安全认证方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5320312/latest

Biometric Authentication (BA) is frequently used for authentication owing to its high recognition rate. The existing biometric hiding algorithms execute data embedding on areas that do not encompass key features of the biometric. Moreover, these techniques lacked authorization. Thus, a Secure Data Transfer model with BA and Blockchain (BC)-based authorization is proposed. Primarily, the data owner registers their details and the registered face and palm image undergoes pre-processing. By employing Pruned Residual Network 50 (PRESNET 50), the facial landmarks are extracted from the pre-processed face image. Next, Digit Folding based Log Facial Jaw Points Curve Cryptographic (DF-LFJPCC) is executed based on the jaw points to generate a secret key. Then, the Tan Sigmoid-based Convolutional Neural Network (TS-CNN) classifier is trained with the features of the pre-processed images and facial landmarks. After registration, the user logins, and their processed face and palm features are given to the trained TS-CNN for authenticating the user. The secret is also used to improve the authentication process. After successful login, the file to be uploaded is converted into cipher, which is then encrypted using Log Facial Jaw Points Curve Cryptographic (LFJPCC) and uploaded to the cloud server. In the end, authorization is performed in the BC based on the hashcode generated using Faro shuffle -Tiger (FS-Tiger) when a user requests data. As per the experimental analysis, the proposed technique outperforms prevailing models.

# Associations between age, red cell distribution width and 180-day and 1-year mortality in giant cell arteritis patients: mediation analyses and machine learning in a cohort study

## 年龄，红细胞分布宽度与巨细胞动脉炎患者180天和1年死亡率之间的关系: 一项队列研究中的中介分析和机器学习

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5059028/latest

Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between age, red cell distribution width (RDW) levels, and 180-day and 1-year mortality in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) using a large cohort from the MIMIC-IV database.Methods Clinical data from patients with GCA were extracted from the MIMIC-IV (3.0) database. Logistic and Cox regression analyses, Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis, and mediation effect analysis were employed to investigate the association between age, RDW levels, and 180-day and 1-year mortality in GCA patients. Predictive models were constructed using machine learning algorithms, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was applied to evaluate the contributions of age and RDW levels to mortality in patients with GCA.Results A total of 228 GCA patients were eligible for analysis. Our study identified both age (OR&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;1, P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.05) and RDW (OR&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;1, P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.05) as significant predictors of 180-day and 1-year mortality in GCA patients using multivariate logistic regression analysis. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, age (HR&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;1, P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.05) and RDW (HR&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;1, P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.05) also emerged as prognostic risk factors for 180-day and 1-year mortality. KM survival analysis further showed that GCA patients with higher age or elevated RDW levels had significantly lower survival rates compared to younger patients or those with lower RDW levels (P&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.0001). Moreover, RCS analysis indicated a strong nonlinear relationship between RDW levels (threshold: 17.53%) and 1-year mortality in GCA patients. Additionally, RDW levels were found to modestly mediate the relationship between age and 180-day or 1-year mortality in GCA patients. The results of the machine learning analysis indicate that the model built using the random forest algorithm performed the best, with an area under the curve of 0.879. Additionally, SHAP analysis revealed that both age and RDW levels made significant contributions to the prediction of mortality in GCA patients.Conclusions Older age and higher RDW levels were independent risk factors for increased 180-day and 1-year mortality in GCA patients. Furthermore, elevated RDW levels slightly mediated the relationship between age and 180-day or 1-year mortality in GCA patients.

# Machine Learning and AVO Class-II Advanced Prospectively Workflow in Upper Messinian; A Successful Story, Offshore Nile Delta, Egypt

## 机器学习和AVO Class-II高级前瞻性工作流在上梅西尼尼亚; 一个成功的故事，离岸尼罗河三角洲，埃及

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4996654/latest

This study presents a comprehensive workflow to detect low seismic amplitude gas fields in hydrocarbon exploration projects, focusing on the West Delta Deep Marine (WDDM) concession, offshore Egypt. The workflow integrates seismic spectral decomposition and machine learning algorithms to identify subtle anomalies, including low seismic amplitude gas sand and background amplitude water sand. Spectral decomposition helps delineate the fairway boundaries and structural features, while Amplitude Versus Offset (AVO) analysis is used to validate gas sand anomalies. The entire seismic volume is classified into facies domains using machine learning, which isolates target features from seismic background data. The study area, covering 1850 km2, includes major structures such as the Rosetta fault and Nile Delta offshore anticline, with reservoirs consisting of layered sandstones and mudstones. Over 90 wells, including exploration and development wells, have been drilled in the area. Seismic amplitude data, including full and partial offset stacked, were analyzed to classify gas, water, and shale zones. The workflow's performance is demonstrated through the successful identification of the low-amplitude Swan-E Messinian anomaly, characterized as a high-risk gas prospect. Machine learning techniques, specifically neural network models, were trained to differentiate seismic features such as low-amplitude gas sand from background-amplitude water sand and shale. By iterating over multiple attributes and validating the models on blind test sets and on a blind section, which excluded a known shallow gas field, the workflow significantly improved the ability to detect potential hydrocarbon reservoirs characterized by low seismic amplitude. The results show that this integrated approach reduces exploration risk, quantifies the chance of success, and enhances decision-making in well placement and hydrocarbon exploration. This method is particularly useful for identifying low seismic amplitude anomalies, which are often challenging to detect with conventional seismic analysis. &amp;bull; This study developed a workflow to detect low seismic amplitude gas fields in near-field exploration. &amp;bull; It uses a machine learning algorithm to classify and explore low-seismic-amplitude gas sand reservoirs. &amp;bull; This approach helps estimate the likelihood of success and reduces the risk associated with hydrocarbon exploration wells.

# AI/ML-based model to investigate the variability of the Fully Depleted SOI MOSFET

## 基于AI/ML的模型研究全耗尽SOI MOSFET的可变性

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5346094/latest

A machine learning-based approach to predict the variability of Fully Depleted Silicon on Insulator (FDSOI) MOSFETs is demonstrated in this paper. Here, mainly On and OFF current (ION and IOFF), Threshold Voltage (VTH), and sub-threshold slope (SS) variability due to device geometries like channel length, body thickness, oxide thickness etc have been investigated in depth using AI/ML framework. The Random Forest Regression (RFR) model has demonstrated substantial effectiveness in evaluating the device characteristics. SILVACO ATLAS-based device simulation produces a dataset of 14627 different readings. Out of different regression and classification methods, the RFR-ML model attains maximum accuracy. The efficacy of the ML frameworks has been measured using mean square error (RMSE) (~&amp;thinsp;0.0001), R2 score (~&amp;thinsp;0.9986), and accuracy (~&amp;thinsp;99.60%) as figures of merit, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art literature. In addition to offering higher accuracy, the model can predict data within seconds, in contrast to the traditional ways. This rapid and precise design approach is highly beneficial for the current VLSI industries in terms of accuracy and precision and achieving scalability and cost-effectiveness.

# MambaLF: An Efficient Local Feature Extraction and Matching with State Space Model

## MambaLF: 一种高效的状态空间局部特征提取与匹配模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5345658/latest

Local feature extraction and matching has lately attracted increasing attention due to its wide application, especially in real-time automated systems. However, existing image matching methods struggle to balance the global receptive field and the efficient computation, which limits the practical applications. Recently, the State Space Model (SSM) has shown great potential in linear complexity and long-range dependency modeling. Therefore, in this paper, a local feature extraction and matching method using the SSM is proposed, which aims to achieve the tradeoff between global information extraction and model complexity. Firstly, a Local and Global Information Fusion (LGIF) block is developed to integrate local and global information and reduce model parameters through parallel SSM. Secondly, a backbone based on Euclidean group E(2) equivariant steerable Convolution (E2Conv) is designed to improve the model's robustness against geometric transformations. Finally, a self-supervised learning framework is constructed, which optimizes the ability of the network in local feature detection and description by combining four loss functions: keypoint localization loss, keypoint confidence score loss, descriptor triplet loss, and keypoint correspondence loss. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets Hpatches and RDNIM demonstrate that the proposed method has a significant advantage over existing methods in homography estimation tasks. Notably, our method outperforms the end-to-end dense matching method LoFTR by 6.11% under the 1-pixel error threshold on the Hpatches dataset, simultaneously with a smaller number of parameters and less average matching time.

# Automatic Recognition and Analysis of Talus Cartilage Lesions Based on Deep Learning

## 基于深度学习的距骨软骨病变自动识别与分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5239493/latest

Osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs) involve damage to cartilage and subchondral bone, necessitating early diagnosis and intervention due to the disease's progressive nature. MRI is the primary diagnostic tool in clinical practice, known for its high sensitivity and specificity. However, early-stage cartilage injuries often present low contrast and poor signal-to-noise ratios, making it challenging for even experienced physicians to accurately detect OLTs, potentially leading to irreversible disease progression. To address this issue, we developed a novel convolutional neural network designed to rapidly and efficiently identify and classify OLTs. Additionally, an OLTS-AI analysis system was created to assist in diagnosis. This study used a training and validation dataset consisting of MRI images from 334 ankle patients at Sichuan Province Orthopedic Hospital. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 96.73%, with detection speeds of 309.8 FPS on CPU and 823.1 FPS on GPU. This system is now implemented in clinical practice, enabling the analysis of talus lesions in just three seconds, significantly reducing doctors' workload while enhancing diagnostic efficiency in managing OLTs effectively.

# Robust Biometric Recognition via InformationBottleneck Multi-Modal Feature Fusion

## 基于信息瓶颈多模态特征融合的鲁棒生物特征识别

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5326504/latest

In recent years, multimodal biometric technology has gained attention due to its enhanced security and accuracy. Compared to unimodal recognition, multimodal feature-based recognition significantly improves accuracy. However, the data differences between various biometric traits (such as face, fingerprint, finger vein, and iris) have introduced two main challenges:1) The presence of considerable redundancy within individual modality information, which weakens classification performance.2) Significant modality imbalance leads to an over-reliance on single modality features, causing other modality information to be overlooked, resulting in overfitting and potential degradation in system performance and security vulnerabilities in multimodal biometric authentication.To address these problems, we first draw inspiration from the information bottleneck principle and design a fusion-based information bottleneck method. This method aims to retain relevant information across multiple modalities while minimizing redundancy, thereby enhancing multimodal representation learning performance. Secondly, We employ feature distribution visualization to elucidate the causes of modality imbalance in the model and propose an adaptive strategy to dynamically discard features from different modalities to mitigate modality imbalance.Finally, we conducted experiments on multiple datasets, and our results demonstrate that our method achieves optimal performance on various datasets, including CASIA, Iris-Fingerprint, and NUPT-FPV, and effectively reduces modality imbalance.

# Research on movie rating based on BERT-base model

## 基于BERT-base模型的电影分级研究

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5255176/latest

The advent of the Internet has led to the ascendance of film reviews as a crucial point of reference for users when making decisions about which films to watch. Furthermore, film reviews play a pivotal role in content recommendation systems for producers and platforms. It is therefore evident that the accurate classification of film reviews holds significant practical value. The traditional manual classification methods are characterised by a high level of time consumption, a considerable labour input, and a susceptibility to subjective biases. Conversely, the application of automated classification through the use of deep learning models has emerged as an efficacious solution to this issue. Among these models, the BERT model, distinguished by its bidirectional encoder architecture, demonstrates particular proficiency in contextual comprehension and semantic extraction. However, it is constrained in its ability to capture long-range dependencies and local features when processing extended texts. In order to address these challenges, this study puts forward a series of proposed improvements to the BERT model. In particular, absolute positional encoding is substituted with dynamic positional bias encoding within the attention mechanism, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to process diverse positional information. Additionally, a dynamic weighted fusion pooling strategy is introduced, which integrates average pooling, max pooling, and self-attention pooling in order to enrich the feature extraction process. Moreover, the model's capacity for generalisation is enhanced through the implementation of Easy Data Augmentation (EDA) techniques and the introduction of noise into the training data. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved BERT model achieves a 0.65% improvement in the F1 score and a 0.83% increase in accuracy, thereby validating the efficacy of the proposed modifications.

# Privacy-enabled and Local-global Hashing with Adaptive Adjustment: a Robust Multi-drone Object Detector

## 具有自适应调整功能的隐私支持和局部全局哈希: 一种鲁棒的多无人机物体检测器

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5399931/latest

Multi-drone object detection aims to robustly localize and identify multi-category objects by training a detector using videos recorded from multiple drones. This task presents three main challenges: 1) maintaining data privacy by keeping videos captured by each drone local during training, 2) generating lightweight deep features for efficient between-object comparison, and 3) accurately encoding object-aware clues in the presence of mislabeled videos. In this work, we propose an encrypted hashing technique to enable distributed and adaptive training of an object detector. The core idea is a local-global learning approach that adapts server parameters to progressively update local (\textit{i.e.}, drone-specific) parameters, optimizing local hash model (LHM) training. Specifically, for each drone, we develop an LHM to convert each sliding window into binary codes for fast comparison. This approach integrates three key attributes: i) correction of mislabeled video data, ii) preservation of explicit data structure, and iii) computation of deep binary codes. Due to the non-convexity of LHM, we introduce an iterative solution. To combine multiple LHMs into a robust global hash model (GHM), we employ an encrypted distributed learning scheme. This allows each LHM to communicate its inherent parameters to the GHM for iterative optimization, with adaptive guidance from the GHM feedback loop enhancing LHM training. Notably, our local-global hash architecture ensures drone data privacy since only LHM parameters are visible externally, while drone-recorded videos are retained locally. Extensive empirical evaluations on three drone image datasets demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of our method. Furthermore, the FPGA implementation of our object detector achieved 265 fps (frames per second) on 1K drone videos and 58 fps on 4K drone videos.

# FragNet: A Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction with Four Layers of Interpretability

## FragNet: 具有四层可解释性的分子特性预测的图神经网络

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5283906/latest

Molecular property prediction is a crucial step in many modern-day scientific applications including drug discovery and energy storage material design. Despite the availability of numerous machine learning models for this task, we are lacking in models that provide both high accuracies and interpretability of the predictions. We introduce the FragNet architecture, a graph neural network not only capable of achieving prediction accuracies comparable to the current state-of-the-art models, but also able to provide insight on four levels of molecular substructures. This model enables understanding of which atoms, bonds, molecular fragments, and molecular fragment connections are critical in the prediction of a given molecular property. The ability to interpret the importance of connections between fragments is of particular interest for molecules which have substructures that are not connected with regular covalent bonds. The interpretable capabilities of FragNet are key to gaining scientific insights from the model&rsquo;s learned patterns between molecular structure and molecular properties.

# Unsupervised local learning based on voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity for resistive and ferroelectric synapses

## 基于电阻和铁电突触的电压依赖性突触可塑性的无监督局部学习

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5295706/latest

In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO2, HfO2-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO4-based ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200 neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as switching thresholds and HRS/LRS levels, and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.

# Dynamic Neural Regeneration Mechanisms for Self-Organized Structural Adaptation in Large Language Models

## 大型语言模型中自组织结构适应的动态神经再生机制

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5409100/latest

The rapid expansion of data-driven applications has demonstrated the limitations inherent in traditional neural network architectures, where static configurations constrain adaptability and impede long-term functionality. The Dynamic Neural Regeneration (DNR) mechanism introduces a groundbreaking approach to structural adaptability, enabling autonomous reconfiguration of neural architectures through a data-responsive regenerative process that recalibrates layers and nodes in real time. Through comprehensive integration within a large language model (LLM), DNR facilitates adaptive structural evolution that aligns model architecture with shifting data distributions, effectively bridging gaps in scalability, robustness, and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the DNR-enabled LLM significantly outperforms conventional static models in metrics such as adaptability, computational efficiency, and accuracy, highlighting its capacity to maintain high performance across diverse and dynamic datasets. This innovation offers notable improvements in computational sustainability, as the model selectively regenerates only those neural components affected by data-driven relevance, thereby optimizing resource allocation without sacrificing model integrity or predictive precision. The findings demonstrate the DNR mechanism as a transformative advancement, offering a scalable, efficient, and self-organizing approach with broad implications for real-world applications that demand long-term adaptability and resilience in evolving data environments.
