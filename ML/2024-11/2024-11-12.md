# Neural network representation of quantum systems

## 量子系统的神经网络表示

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad81ac

It has been proposed that random wide neural networks near Gaussian process are quantum field theories around Gaussian fixed points. In this paper, we provide a novel map with which a wide class of quantum mechanical systems can be cast into the form of a neural network with a statistical summation over network parameters. Our simple idea is to use the universal approximation theorem of neural networks to generate arbitrary paths in the Feynman’s path integral. The map can be applied to interacting quantum systems / field theories, even away from the Gaussian limit. Our findings bring machine learning closer to the quantum world.

# Towards harmonization of SO(3)-equivariance and expressiveness: a hybrid deep learning framework for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction

## 走向SO(3)-等方差和表现力的协调: 用于电子结构哈密顿量预测的混合深度学习框架

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad8d30

Deep learning for predicting the electronic-structure Hamiltonian of quantum systems necessitates satisfying the covariance laws, among which achieving SO(3)-equivariance without sacrificing the non-linear expressive capability of networks remains unsolved. To navigate the harmonization between SO(3)-equivariance and expressiveness, we propose HarmoSE, a deep learning method synergizing two distinct categories of neural mechanisms as a two-stage encoding and regression framework. The first stage corresponds to group theory-based neural mechanisms with inherent SO(3)-equivariant properties prior to the parameter learning process, while the second stage is characterized by a non-linear 3D graph Transformer network we propose, featuring high capability on non-linear expressiveness. Their combination lies in the point that, the first stage predicts baseline Hamiltonians with abundant SO(3)-equivariant features extracted, assisting the second stage in empirical learning of equivariance; and in turn, the second stage refines the first stage’s output as a fine-grained prediction of Hamiltonians using powerful non-linear neural mappings, compensating for the intrinsic weakness on non-linear expressiveness capability of mechanisms in the first stage. Our method enables precise, generalizable predictions while capturing SO(3)-equivariance under rotational transformations, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in Hamiltonian prediction tasks under multiple mean absolute error (MAE) metrics, such as the average MAE across all samples and matrix elements, the MAE for challenging samples, the MAE for different Hamiltonian blocks, and the MAE for the challenging blocks. It also demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy for downstream quantities, such as occupied orbital energy and the electronic wavefunction, as measured by MAE and cosine similarity, respectively.

# Predicting ionic conductivity in solids from the machine-learned potential energy landscape

## 从机器学习的势能景观预测固体中的离子电导率

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06804

arXiv:2411.06804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering new superionic materials is essential for advancing solid-state batteries, which offer improved energy density and safety compared to the traditional lithium-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes. Conventional computational methods for identifying such materials are resource-intensive and not easily scalable. Recently, universal interatomic potential models have been developed using equivariant graph neural networks. These models are trained on extensive datasets of first-principles force and energy calculations. One can achieve significant computational advantages by leveraging them as the foundation for traditional methods of assessing the ionic conductivity, such as molecular dynamics or nudged elastic band techniques. However, the generalization error from model inference on diverse atomic structures arising in such calculations can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we propose an approach for the quick and reliable evaluation of ionic conductivity through the analysis of a universal interatomic potential. Our method incorporates a set of heuristic structure descriptors that effectively employ the rich knowledge of the underlying model while requiring minimal generalization capabilities. Using our descriptors, we rank lithium-containing materials in the Materials Project database according to their expected ionic conductivity. Eight out of the ten highest-ranked materials are confirmed to be superionic at room temperature in first-principles calculations. Notably, our method achieves a speed-up factor of approximately 50 compared to molecular dynamics driven by a machine-learning potential, and is at least 3,000 times faster compared to first-principles molecular dynamics.

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06972

arXiv:2411.06972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excess free energy functional of classical density functional theory depends upon the type of fluid model, specifically on the choice of (pair) potential, is unknown in general, and is approximated reliably only in special cases. We present a machine learning scheme for training a neural network that acts as a generic metadensity functional for truncated but otherwise arbitrary pair potentials. Automatic differentiation and neural functional calculus then yield, for one-dimensional fluids, accurate predictions for inhomogeneous states and immediate access to the pair distribution function. The approach provides a means of addressing a fundamental problem in the physics of liquids, and for soft matter design: How best to invert structural data to obtain the pair potential?

arXiv:2411.06973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the orientational properties of a homogeneous and inhomogeneous tetrahedral 4-patch fluid (Kern--Frenkel model). Using integral equations, either (i) HNC or (ii) a modified HNC scheme with simulation input, the full orientational dependence of pair and direct correlation functions is determined. Density functionals for the inhomogeneous problem are constructed via two different methods. The first, molecular density functional theory, utilizes the full direct correlation function and an isotropic hard-sphere bridge functional. The second method, a machine learning approach, uses a decomposition of the functional into an isotropic reference part and a mean-field orientational part, where both parts are improved by machine learning techniques. Comparison to simulation data at hard walls and around hard tracers show a similar performance of the two functionals. Machine learning strategies are discussed to eliminate residual differences, with the goal of obtaining machine-learning enhanced functionals for the general anisotropic fluid.

# Autoregressive neural quantum states of Fermi Hubbard models

## 费米哈伯德模型的自回归神经量子态

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07144

arXiv:2411.07144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful ansatz for variational quantum Monte Carlo studies of strongly-correlated systems. Here, we apply recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and autoregressive transformer neural networks to the Fermi-Hubbard and the (non-Hermitian) Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. In both cases, we observe that the convergence of the RNN ansatz is challenged when increasing the interaction strength. We present a physically-motivated and easy-to-implement strategy for improving the optimization, namely, by ramping of the model parameters. Furthermore, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the autoregressive sampling property of both network architectures. For the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model, we identify convergence issues that stem from the autoregressive sampling scheme in combination with the non-Hermitian nature of the model. Our findings provide insights into the challenges of the NQS approach and make the first step towards exploring strongly-correlated electrons using this ansatz.

# Input-Driven Dynamics for Robust Memory Retrieval in Hopfield Networks

## Hopfield网络中用于鲁棒内存检索的输入驱动动力学

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05849

arXiv:2411.05849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield model provides a mathematically idealized yet insightful framework for understanding the mechanisms of memory storage and retrieval in the human brain. This model has inspired four decades of extensive research on learning and retrieval dynamics, capacity estimates, and sequential transitions among memories. Notably, the role and impact of external inputs has been largely underexplored, from their effects on neural dynamics to how they facilitate effective memory retrieval. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel dynamical system framework in which the external input directly influences the neural synapses and shapes the energy landscape of the Hopfield model. This plasticity-based mechanism provides a clear energetic interpretation of the memory retrieval process and proves effective at correctly classifying highly mixed inputs. Furthermore, we integrate this model within the framework of modern Hopfield architectures, using this connection to elucidate how current and past information are combined during the retrieval process. Finally, we embed both the classic and the new model in an environment disrupted by noise and compare their robustness during memory retrieval.

# Thermodynamically-Informed Iterative Neural Operators for Heterogeneous Elastic Localization

## 用于异质弹性定位的热力学通知迭代神经算子

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06529

arXiv:2411.06529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering problems frequently require solution of governing equations with spatially-varying discontinuous coefficients. Even for linear elliptic problems, mapping large ensembles of coefficient fields to solutions can become a major computational bottleneck using traditional numerical solvers. Furthermore, machine learning methods such as neural operators struggle to fit these maps due to sharp transitions and high contrast in the coefficient fields and a scarcity of informative training data. In this work, we focus on a canonical problem in computational mechanics: prediction of local elastic deformation fields over heterogeneous material structures subjected to periodic boundary conditions. We construct a hybrid approximation for the coefficient-to-solution map using a Thermodynamically-informed Iterative Neural Operator (TherINO). Rather than using coefficient fields as direct inputs and iterating over a learned latent space, we employ thermodynamic encodings -- drawn from the constitutive equations -- and iterate over the solution space itself. Through an extensive series of case studies, we elucidate the advantages of these design choices in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility. We also analyze the model's stability and extrapolation properties on out-of-distribution coefficient fields and demonstrate an improved speed-accuracy tradeoff for predicting elastic quantities of interest.

# A Fully Analog Pipeline for Portfolio Optimization

## 用于投资组合优化的完全模拟管道

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06566

arXiv:2411.06566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a ubiquitous problem in financial mathematics that relies on accurate estimates of covariance matrices for asset returns. However, estimates of pairwise covariance could be better and calculating time-sensitive optimal portfolios is energy-intensive for digital computers. We present an energy-efficient, fast, and fully analog pipeline for solving portfolio optimization problems that overcomes these limitations. The analog paradigm leverages the fundamental principles of physics to recover accurate optimal portfolios in a two-step process. Firstly, we utilize equilibrium propagation, an analog alternative to backpropagation, to train linear autoencoder neural networks to calculate low-rank covariance matrices. Then, analog continuous Hopfield networks output the minimum variance portfolio for a given desired expected return. The entire efficient frontier may then be recovered, and an optimal portfolio selected based on risk appetite.

arXiv:2312.14552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in accelerated materials innovation in the context of the process-structure-property chain. In this regard, it is essential to take into account manufacturing processes and tailor materials design approaches to support downstream process design approaches. As a major step into this direction, we present a holistic and generic optimization approach that covers the entire process-structure-property chain in materials engineering. Our approach specifically employs machine learning to address two critical identification problems: a materials design problem, which involves identifying near-optimal material microstructures that exhibit desired properties, and a process design problem that is to find an optimal processing path to manufacture these microstructures. Both identification problems are typically ill-posed, which presents a significant challenge for solution approaches. However, the non-unique nature of these problems offers an important advantage for processing: By having several target microstructures that perform similarly well, processes can be efficiently guided towards manufacturing the best reachable microstructure. The functionality of the approach is demonstrated at manufacturing crystallographic textures with desired properties in a simulated metal forming process.

arXiv:2401.07232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neuromorphic network architecture based on a lattice of exciton-polariton condensates, intricately interconnected and energized through non-resonant optical pumping. The network employs a binary framework, where each neuron, facilitated by the spatial coherence of pairwise coupled condensates, performs binary operations. This coherence, emerging from the ballistic propagation of polaritons, ensures efficient, network-wide communication. The binary neuron switching mechanism, driven by the nonlinear repulsion through the excitonic component of polaritons, offers computational efficiency and scalability advantages over continuous weight neural networks. Our network enables parallel processing, enhancing computational speed compared to sequential or pulse-coded binary systems. The system's performance was evaluated using diverse datasets, including the MNIST dataset for image recognition and the Speech Commands dataset for voice recognition tasks. In both scenarios, the proposed system demonstrates the potential to outperform existing polaritonic neuromorphic systems. For image recognition, this is evidenced by an impressive predicted classification accuracy of up to 97.5%. In voice recognition, the system achieved a classification accuracy of about 68\% for the ten-class subset, surpassing the performance of conventional benchmark, the Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture Model.

arXiv:2402.17781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Diamond Microscopy using Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) defects in diamond crystals has enabled the magnetic field imaging of a wide variety of nanoscale current profiles. Intimately linked with the imaging process is the problem of reconstructing the current density, which provides critical insight into the structure under study. This manifests as a non-trivial inverse problem of current reconstruction from noisy data, typically conducted via Fourier-based approaches. Learning algorithms and Bayesian methods have been proposed as novel alternatives for inference-based reconstructions. We study the applicability of Fourier-based and Bayesian methods for reconstructing two-dimensional current density maps from magnetic field images obtained from NV imaging. We discuss extensive numerical simulations to elucidate the performance of the reconstruction algorithms in various parameter regimes, and further validate our analysis via performing reconstructions on experimental data. Finally, we examine parameter regimes that favor specific reconstruction algorithms and provide an empirical approach for selecting regularization in Bayesian methods.

# Enabling Efficient Equivariant Operations in the Fourier Basis via Gaunt Tensor Products

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10216

arXiv:2401.10216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing equivariant neural networks for the E(3) group plays an important role in modeling 3D data across real-world applications. Enforcing this equivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such operations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients, the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication between spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be efficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms. This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of irreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, which serves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations across different model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and 3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improved performance of our approach.

Abstract: Multicellular self-assembly into functional structures is a dynamic process that is critical in the development and diseases, including embryo development, organ formation, tumor invasion, and others. Being able to infer collective cell migratory dynamics from their static configuration is valuable for both understanding and predicting these complex processes. However, the identification of structural features that can indicate multicellular motion has been difficult, and existing metrics largely rely on physical instincts. Here we show that using a graph neural network (GNN), the motion of multicellular collectives can be inferred from a static snapshot of cell positions, in both experimental and synthetic datasets.

# ConvNet-Based Prediction of Droplet Collision Dynamics in Microchannels

## 基于ConvNet的微通道内液滴碰撞动力学预测

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05840

arXiv:2411.05840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of droplet collisions in microchannels are inherently complex, governed by multiple interdependent physical and geometric factors. Understanding and predicting the outcomes of these collisions-whether coalescence, reverse-back, or pass-over-pose significant challenges, particularly due to the deformability of droplets and the influence of key parameters such as viscosity ratios, density ratios, confinement, and initial offset of droplets. Traditional methods for analyzing these collisions, including computational simulations and experimental techniques, are time-consuming and resource-intensive, limiting their scalability for real-time applications. In this work, we explore a novel data-driven approach to predict droplet collision outcomes using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN-based approach presents a significant advantage over traditional methods, offering faster, scalable solutions for analyzing large datasets with varying physical parameters. Using a lattice Boltzmann method based on Cahn-Hilliard diffuse interface theory for binary immiscible fluids, we numerically generated droplet collision data under confined shear flow. This data, represented as droplet shapes, serves as input to the CNN model, which automatically learns hierarchical features from the images, allowing for accurate and efficient collision outcome predictions based on deformation and orientation. The model achieves a prediction accuracy of 0.972, even on test datasets with varied density and viscosity ratios not included in training. Our findings suggest that the CNN-based models offer improved accuracy in predicting collision outcomes while drastically reducing computational and time constraints. This work highlights the potential of machine learning to advance droplet dynamics studies, providing a valuable tool for researchers in fluid dynamics and soft matter.

# Are Deep Learning Methods Suitable for Downscaling Global Climate Projections? Review and Intercomparison of Existing Models

## 深度学习方法是否适合缩小全球气候预测？现有模型的回顾和比较

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05850

arXiv:2411.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise for downscaling global climate change projections under different approaches, including Perfect Prognosis (PP) and Regional Climate Model (RCM) emulation. Unlike emulators, PP downscaling models are trained on observational data, so it remains an open question whether they can plausibly extrapolate unseen conditions and changes in future emissions scenarios. Here we focus on this problem as the main drawback for the operationalization of these methods and present the results of 1) a literature review to identify state-of-the-art DL models for PP downscaling and 2) an intercomparison experiment to evaluate the performance of these models and to assess their extrapolation capability using a common experimental framework, taking into account the sensitivity of results to different training replicas. We focus on minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation over Spain, a region with a range of climatic conditions with different influential regional processes. We conclude with a discussion of the findings, limitations of existing methods, and prospects for future development.

## 应对城市酷热: 一种机器学习方法，用于评估气候变化的影响以及城市小气候中气候适应策略的有效性

arXiv:2411.05952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat becomes a priority for climate adaptation efforts. High temperatures concentrated in urban heat can drive increased risk of heat-related death and illness as well as increased energy demand for cooling. However, estimating the effects of urban heat is an ongoing field of research typically burdened by an imprecise description of the built environment, significant computational cost, and a lack of high-resolution estimates of the impacts of climate change. Here, we present open-source, computationally efficient machine learning methods that can improve the accuracy of urban temperature estimates when compared to historical reanalysis data. These models are applied to residential buildings in Los Angeles, and we compare the energy benefits of heat mitigation strategies to the impacts of climate change. We find that cooling demand is likely to increase substantially through midcentury, but engineered high-albedo surfaces could lessen this increase by more than 50%. The corresponding increase in heating demand complicates this narrative, but total annual energy use from combined heating and cooling with electric heat pumps in the Los Angeles urban climate is shown to benefit from the engineered cooling strategies under both current and future climates.

# Dictionary Learning with Convolutional Structure for Seismic Data Denoising and Interpolation

## 用于地震数据去噪和插值的卷积结构字典学习

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05956

arXiv:2411.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic data inevitably suffers from random noise and missing traces in field acquisition. This limits the utilization of seismic data for subsequent imaging or inversion applications. Recently, dictionary learning has gained remarkable success in seismic data denoising and interpolation. Variants of the patch-based learning technique, such as the K-SVD algorithm, have been shown to improve denoising and interpolation performance compared to the analytic transform-based methods. However, patch-based learning algorithms work on overlapping patches of data and do not take the full data into account during reconstruction. By contrast, the data patches (CSC) model treats signals globally and, therefore, has shown superior performance over patch-based methods in several image processing applications. In consequence, we test the use of CSC model for seismic data denoising and interpolation. In particular, we use the local block coordinate descent (LoBCoD) algorithm to reconstruct missing traces and clean seismic data from noisy input. The denoising and interpolation performance of the LoBCoD algorithm has been compared with that of K-SVD and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithms using synthetic and field data examples. We use three quality measures to test the denoising accuracy: the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the relative L2-norm of the error (RLNE), and the structural similarity index (SSIM). We find that LoBCoD performs better than K-SVD and OMP for all test cases in improving PSNR and SSIM, and in reducing RLNE. These observations suggest a huge potential of the CSC model in seismic data denoising and interpolation applications.

# A deep learning model for inter-fraction head and neck anatomical changes

## 一种分段间头颈部解剖变化的深度学习模型

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06252

arXiv:2411.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To assess the performance of a probabilistic deep learning based algorithm for predicting inter-fraction anatomical changes in head and neck patients.
  Approach: A probabilistic daily anatomy model for head and neck patients $(\mathrm{DAM}_{\mathrm{HN}})$ is built on the variational autoencoder architecture. The model approximates the generative joint conditional probability distribution of the repeat computed tomography (rCT) images and their corresponding masks on the planning CT images (pCT) and their masks. The model outputs deformation vector fields, which are used to produce possible rCTs and associated masks. The dataset is composed of 93 patients (i.e., 367 pCT - rCT pairs), 9 (i.e., 37 pairs) of which were set aside for final testing. The performance of the model is assessed based on the reconstruction accuracy and the generative performance for the set aside patients.
  Main results: The model achieves a DICE score of 0.92 and an image similarity score of 0.65 on the test set. The generated parotid glands volume change distributions and center of mass shift distributions were also assessed. For both, the medians of the distributions are close to the true ones, and the distributions are broad enough to encompass the real observed changes. Moreover, the generated images display anatomical changes in line with the literature reported ones, such as the medial shifts of the parotids glands.
  Significance: $(\mathrm{DAM}_{\mathrm{HN}})$ is capable of generating realistic anatomies observed during the course of the treatment and has applications in anatomical robust optimization, treatment planning based on plan library approaches and robustness evaluation against inter-fractional changes.

# Deep Learning in Classical X-ray Ghost Imaging for Dose Reduction

## 经典x射线鬼成像中剂量降低的深度学习

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06340

arXiv:2411.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) is an unconventional technique that combines information from two correlated patterned light fields to compute an image of the object of interest. GI can be performed with visible light as well as penetrating radiation such as x-rays, electrons, etc. Penetrating radiation is usually ionizing and damages biological specimens; therefore, minimising the dose of this radiation in a medical or biological imaging context is important. GI has been proposed as a potential way to achieve this. With prior knowledge of the object of interest, such as sparsity in a specific basis (e.g., Fourier basis) or access to a large dataset for neural network training, it is possible to reconstruct an image of the object with a limited number of measurements. However, low sampling does not inherently equate to low dose. Here, we specifically explore the scenario where reduced sampling corresponds to low-dose conditions. In this simulation-based paper, we examine how deep learning (DL) techniques could reduce dose in classical x-ray GI. Since GI is based on illumination patterns, we start by exploring optimal sets of patterns that allow us to reconstruct the image with the fewest measurements, or lowest sampling rate, possible. We then propose a DL neural network that can directly reconstruct images from GI measurements even when the sampling rate is extremely low. We demonstrate that our deep learning-based GI (DLGI) approach has potential in image reconstruction, with results comparable to direct imaging (DI) at the same dose. However, given the same prior knowledge and detector quantum efficiency, it is very challenging for DLGI to outperform DI under low-dose conditions. We discuss how it may be achievable due to the higher sensitivity of bucket detectors over pixel detectors.

# Multi-Parameter Molecular MRI Quantification using Physics-Informed Self-Supervised Learning

## 使用物理信息自监督学习的多参数分子MRI量化

arXiv:2411.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biophysical model fitting plays a key role in obtaining quantitative parameters from physiological signals and images. However, the model complexity for molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often translates into excessive computation time, which makes clinical use impractical. Here, we present a generic computational approach for solving the parameter extraction inverse problem posed by ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling coupled with experimental measurement of the system dynamics. This is achieved by formulating a numerical ODE solver to function as a step-wise analytical one, thereby making it compatible with automatic differentiation-based optimization. This enables efficient gradient-based model fitting, and provides a new approach to parameter quantification based on self-supervised learning from a single data observation. The neural-network-based train-by-fit pipeline was used to quantify semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) amide proton exchange parameters in the human brain, in an in-vivo molecular MRI study (n=4). The entire pipeline of the first whole brain quantification was completed in 18.3$\pm$8.3 minutes, which is an order-of-magnitude faster than comparable alternatives. Reusing the single-subject-trained network for inference in new subjects took 1.0$\pm$0.2 s, to provide results in agreement with literature values and scan-specific fit results (Pearson's r>0.98, p<0.0001).

Overall, our results both qualify and quantify the epistemological shift in the description of the life-cycle of a cloud (from the general physics of the water cycle to detailed description of cloud microphysical processes) as learners mature in their understanding of the discipline. A triangulation of data sources with a panel of experts in the discipline complements and confirms our findings. These can be used by lecturers to tailor their teaching towards the identified expert-like concepts, and by students to anticipate the main complexities in the field during their learning process.

# Machine Learning-based Denoising of Surface Solar Irradiance simulated with Monte Carlo Ray Tracing

Abstract: Simulating radiative transfer in the atmosphere with Monte Carlo ray tracing provides realistic surface irradiance in cloud-resolving models. However, Monte Carlo methods are computationally expensive because large sampling budgets are required to obtain sufficient convergence. Here, we explore the use of machine learning for denoising direct and diffuse surface solar irradiance fields. We use Monte Carlo ray tracing to compute pairs of noisy and well-converged surface irradiance fields for an ensemble of cumulus cloud fields and solar angles, and train a denoising autoencoder to predict the well-converged irradiance fields from the noisy input. We demonstrate that denoising diffuse irradiance from 1 sample per pixel (per spectral quadrature point) is an order of magnitude faster and twice as accurate as ray tracing with 128 samples per pixel, illustrating the advantage of denoising over larger sampling budgets. Denoising of direct irradiance is effective in sunlit areas, while errors persist on the edges of cloud shadows. For diffuse irradiance, providing additional atmospheric information such as liquid water paths and solar angles to train the denoising algorithm reduces errors by approximately a factor of two. Our results open up possibilities for coupled Monte Carlo ray tracing with computational costs approaching those of two-stream-based radiative transfer solvers, although future work is needed to improve generalization across resolutions and cloud types.

# An Analysis of Deep Learning Parameterizations for Ocean Subgrid Eddy Forcing

## 海洋亚网格涡旋强迫的深度学习参数化分析

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06604

arXiv:2411.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to computational constraints, climate simulations cannot resolve a range of small-scale physical processes, which have a significant impact on the large-scale evolution of the climate system. Parameterization is an approach to capture the effect of these processes, without resolving them explicitly. In recent years, data-driven parameterizations based on convolutional neural networks have obtained promising results. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of these parameterizations developed using data from ocean simulations. The parametrizations account for the effect of mesoscale eddies toward improving simulations of momentum, heat, and mass exchange in the ocean. Our results provide several insights into the properties of data-driven parameterizations based on neural networks. First, their performance can be substantially improved by increasing the geographic extent of the training data. Second, they learn nonlinear structure, since they are able to outperform a linear baseline. Third, they generalize robustly across different CO2 forcings, but not necessarily across different ocean depths. Fourth, they exploit a relatively small region of their input to generate their output. Our results will guide the further development of ocean mesoscale eddy parameterizations, and multiscale modeling more generally.

arXiv:2411.07018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field emission can cause significant problems in superconducting radio-frequency linear accelerators (linacs). When cavity gradients are pushed higher, radiation levels within the linacs may rise exponentially, causing degradation of many nearby systems. This research aims to utilize machine learning with uncertainty quantification to predict radiation levels at multiple locations throughout the linacs and ultimately optimize cavity gradients to reduce field emission induced radiation while maintaining the total linac energy gain necessary for the experimental physics program. The optimized solutions show over 40% reductions for both neutron and gamma radiation from the standard operational settings.

# A Fully Analog Pipeline for Portfolio Optimization

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06566

arXiv:2411.06566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a ubiquitous problem in financial mathematics that relies on accurate estimates of covariance matrices for asset returns. However, estimates of pairwise covariance could be better and calculating time-sensitive optimal portfolios is energy-intensive for digital computers. We present an energy-efficient, fast, and fully analog pipeline for solving portfolio optimization problems that overcomes these limitations. The analog paradigm leverages the fundamental principles of physics to recover accurate optimal portfolios in a two-step process. Firstly, we utilize equilibrium propagation, an analog alternative to backpropagation, to train linear autoencoder neural networks to calculate low-rank covariance matrices. Then, analog continuous Hopfield networks output the minimum variance portfolio for a given desired expected return. The entire efficient frontier may then be recovered, and an optimal portfolio selected based on risk appetite.

# Optimized Quality of Service prediction in FSO Links over South Africa using Ensemble Learning

## 使用集成学习优化南非FSO链接中的服务质量预测

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06832

arXiv:2411.06832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibre optic communication system is expected to increase exponentially in terms of application due to the numerous advantages over copper wires. The optical network evolution presents several advantages such as over long-distance, low-power requirement, higher carrying capacity and high bandwidth among others Such network bandwidth surpasses methods of transmission that include copper cables and microwaves. Despite these benefits, free-space optical communications are severely impacted by harsh weather situations like mist, precipitation, blizzard, fume, soil, and drizzle debris in the atmosphere, all of which have an impact on the Quality of Service (QoS) rendered by the systems. The primary goal of this article is to optimize the QoS using the ensemble learning models Random Forest, ADaBoost Regression, Stacking Regression, Gradient Boost Regression, and Multilayer Neural Network. To accomplish the stated goal, meteorological data, visibility, wind speed, and altitude were obtained from the South Africa Weather Services archive during a ten-year period (2010 to 2019) at four different locations: Polokwane, Kimberley, Bloemfontein, and George. We estimated the data rate, power received, fog-induced attenuation, bit error rate and power penalty using the collected and processed data. The RMSE and R-squared values of the model across all the study locations, Polokwane, Kimberley, Bloemfontein, and George, are 0.0073 and 0.9951, 0.0065 and 0.9998, 0.0060 and 0.9941, and 0.0032 and 0.9906, respectively. The result showed that using ensemble learning techniques in transmission modeling can significantly enhance service quality and meet customer service level agreements and ensemble method was successful in efficiently optimizing the signal to noise ratio, which in turn enhanced the QoS at the point of reception.

# Reconstruction of neuromorphic dynamics from a single scalar time series using variational autoencoder and neural network map

## 使用变分自动编码器和神经网络映射从单个标量时间序列重建神经形态动力学

arXiv:2411.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the reconstruction of a family of dynamical systems with neuromorphic behavior using a single scalar time series. A model of a physiological neuron based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is considered. Single time series of one of its variables is shown to be enough to train a neural network that can operate as a discrete time dynamical system with one control parameter. The neural network system is created in two steps. First, the delay-coordinate embedding vectors are constructed form the original time series and their dimension is reduced with by means of a variational autoencoder to obtain the recovered state-space vectors. It is shown that an appropriate reduced dimension can be determined by analyzing the autoencoder training process. Second, pairs of the recovered state-space vectors at consecutive time steps supplied with a constant value playing the role of a control parameter are used to train another neural network to make it operate as a recurrent map. The regimes of thus created neural network system observed when its control parameter is varied are in very good accordance with those of the original system, though they were not explicitly presented during training.

# Pi theorem formulation of flood mapping

arXiv:2211.00636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid delineation of flash flood extents is critical to mobilize emergency resources and to manage evacuations, thereby saving lives and property. Machine learning (ML) approaches enable rapid flood delineation with reduced computational demand compared to conventional high-resolution, 2D flood models. However, existing ML approaches are limited by a lack of generalization to never-before-seen conditions. Here, we propose a framework to improve ML model generalization based on dimensionless, multi-scale features that capture the similarity of the flooding process across regions. The dimensionless features are constrained with the Buckingham $\Pi$ theorem and used with a logistic regression model for a probabilistic determination of flood risk. The features were calculated at different scales by varying accumulation thresholds for stream delineation. The modeled flood maps compared well with the results of 2D hydraulic models that are the basis of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood hazard maps. Dimensionless features outperformed dimensional features, with some of the largest gains (in the AUC) occurring when the model was trained in one region and tested in another. Dimensionless and multi-scale features in ML flood modeling have the potential to improve generalization, enabling mapping in unmapped areas and across a broader spectrum of landscapes, climates, and events.

# Hard-constrained neural networks for modelling nonlinear acoustics

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15511

arXiv:2305.15511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model acoustic dynamics in space and time from synthetic sensor data. The tasks are (i) to predict and extrapolate the spatiotemporal dynamics, and (ii) reconstruct the acoustic state from partial observations. To achieve this, we develop acoustic neural networks that learn from sensor data, whilst being constrained by prior knowledge on acoustic and wave physics by both informing the training and constraining parts of the network's architecture as an inductive bias. First, we show that standard feedforward neural networks are unable to extrapolate in time, even in the simplest case of periodic oscillations. Second, we constrain the prior knowledge on acoustics in increasingly effective ways by (i) employing periodic activations (periodically activated neural networks); (ii) informing the training of the networks with a penalty term that favours solutions that fulfil the governing equations (soft-constrained); (iii) constraining the architecture in a physically-motivated solution space (hard-constrained); and (iv) combination of these. Third, we apply the networks on two testcases for two tasks in nonlinear regimes, from periodic to chaotic oscillations. The first testcase is a twin experiment, in which the data is produced by a prototypical time-delayed model. In the second testcase, the data is generated by a higher-fidelity model with mean-flow effects and a kinematic model for the flame source. We find that (i) constraining the physics in the architecture improves interpolation whilst requiring smaller network sizes, (ii) extrapolation in time is achieved by periodic activations, and (iii) velocity can be reconstructed accurately from only pressure measurements with a combination of physics-based hard and soft constraints. In and beyond acoustics, this work opens strategies for constraining the physics in the architecture, rather than the training.

# Experts' cognition-driven ensemble deep learning for external validation of predicting pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy from histological images in breast cancer

## 专家认知驱动的集成深度学习用于从乳腺癌组织学图像预测新辅助化疗病理完全反应的外部验证

Abstract: In breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) provides a standard treatment option for patients who have locally advanced cancer and some large operable tumors. A patient will have better prognosis when he has achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) with the treatment of NAC. There has been a trend to directly predict pCR to NAC from histological images based on deep learning (DL). However, the DL-based predictive models numerically have better performances in internal validation than in external validation. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this situation with an intrinsic approach. We propose an experts' cognition-driven ensemble deep learning (ECDEDL) approach. Taking the cognition of both pathology and artificial intelligence experts into consideration to improve the generalization of the predictive model to the external validation, ECDEDL can intrinsically approximate the working paradigm of a human being which will refer to his various working experiences to make decisions. ECDEDL was validated with 695 WSIs collected from the same center as the primary dataset to develop the predictive model and perform the internal validation, and was also validated with 340 WSIs collected from other three centers as the external dataset to perform the external validation. In external validation, ECDEDL improves the AUCs of pCR prediction from 61.52(59.80-63.26) to 67.75(66.74-68.80) and the Accuracies of pCR prediction from 56.09(49.39-62.79) to 71.01(69.44-72.58). ECDEDL was quite effective for external validation of predicting pCR to NAC from histological images in breast cancer, numerically approximating the internal validation.

Abstract: Multicellular self-assembly into functional structures is a dynamic process that is critical in the development and diseases, including embryo development, organ formation, tumor invasion, and others. Being able to infer collective cell migratory dynamics from their static configuration is valuable for both understanding and predicting these complex processes. However, the identification of structural features that can indicate multicellular motion has been difficult, and existing metrics largely rely on physical instincts. Here we show that using a graph neural network (GNN), the motion of multicellular collectives can be inferred from a static snapshot of cell positions, in both experimental and synthetic datasets.

arXiv:2409.07339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling simulations make the computational study of rare events feasible. A large family of such methods crucially depends on the definition of some collective variables (CVs) that could provide a low-dimensional representation of the relevant physics of the process. Recently, many methods have been proposed to semi-automatize the CV design by using machine learning tools to learn the variables directly from the simulation data. However, most methods are based on feed-forward neural networks and require as input some user-defined physical descriptors. Here, we propose to bypass this step using a graph neural network to directly use the atomic coordinates as input for the CV model. This way, we achieve a fully automatic approach to CV determination that provides variables invariant under the relevant symmetries, especially the permutational one. Furthermore, we provide different analysis tools to favor the physical interpretation of the final CV. We prove the robustness of our approach using different methods from the literature for the optimization of the CV, and we prove its efficacy on several systems, including a small peptide, an ion dissociation in explicit solvent, and a simple chemical reaction.

Abstract: From ancient to modern times, acoustic structures have been used to control the propagation of acoustic waves. However, the design of the acoustic structures has remained widely a time-consuming and computational resource-consuming iterative process. In recent years, Deep Learning has attracted unprecedented attention for its ability to tackle hard problems with huge datasets, which has achieved state-of-the-art results in various tasks. In this work, an acoustic structure design method is proposed based on deep learning. Taking the design of multi-order Helmholtz resonator for instance, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method is not only able to give a very accurate prediction of the geometry of the acoustic structures with multiple strong-coupling parameters, but also capable of improving the performance of evolutionary approaches in optimization for a desired property. Compared with the conventional numerical methods, our method is more efficient, universal and automatic, which has a wide range of potential applications, such as speech enhancement, sound absorption and insulation.

# Waveflow: boundary-conditioned normalizing flows applied to fermionic wavefunctions

arXiv:2211.14839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An efficient and expressive wavefunction ansatz is key to scalable solutions for complex many-body electronic structures. While Slater determinants are predominantly used for constructing antisymmetric electronic wavefunction ans\"{a}tze, this construction can result in limited expressiveness when the targeted wavefunction is highly complex. In this work, we introduce Waveflow, an innovative framework for learning many-body fermionic wavefunctions using boundary-conditioned normalizing flows. Instead of relying on Slater determinants, Waveflow imposes antisymmetry by defining the fundamental domain of the wavefunction and applying necessary boundary conditions. A key challenge in using normalizing flows for this purpose is addressing the topological mismatch between the prior and target distributions. We propose using O-spline priors and I-spline bijections to handle this mismatch, which allows for flexibility in the node number of the distribution while automatically maintaining its square-normalization property. We apply Waveflow to a one-dimensional many-electron system, where we variationally minimize the system's energy using variational quantum Monte Carlo (VQMC). Our experiments demonstrate that Waveflow can effectively resolve topological mismatches and faithfully learn the ground-state wavefunction.

arXiv:2401.07232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel neuromorphic network architecture based on a lattice of exciton-polariton condensates, intricately interconnected and energized through non-resonant optical pumping. The network employs a binary framework, where each neuron, facilitated by the spatial coherence of pairwise coupled condensates, performs binary operations. This coherence, emerging from the ballistic propagation of polaritons, ensures efficient, network-wide communication. The binary neuron switching mechanism, driven by the nonlinear repulsion through the excitonic component of polaritons, offers computational efficiency and scalability advantages over continuous weight neural networks. Our network enables parallel processing, enhancing computational speed compared to sequential or pulse-coded binary systems. The system's performance was evaluated using diverse datasets, including the MNIST dataset for image recognition and the Speech Commands dataset for voice recognition tasks. In both scenarios, the proposed system demonstrates the potential to outperform existing polaritonic neuromorphic systems. For image recognition, this is evidenced by an impressive predicted classification accuracy of up to 97.5%. In voice recognition, the system achieved a classification accuracy of about 68\% for the ten-class subset, surpassing the performance of conventional benchmark, the Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture Model.

Abstract: This work introduces E3x, a software package for building neural networks that are equivariant with respect to the Euclidean group $\mathrm{E}(3)$, consisting of translations, rotations, and reflections of three-dimensional space. Compared to ordinary neural networks, $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariant models promise benefits whenever input and/or output data are quantities associated with three-dimensional objects. This is because the numeric values of such quantities (e.g. positions) typically depend on the chosen coordinate system. Under transformations of the reference frame, the values change predictably, but the underlying rules can be difficult to learn for ordinary machine learning models. With built-in $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariance, neural networks are guaranteed to satisfy the relevant transformation rules exactly, resulting in superior data efficiency and accuracy. The code for E3x is available from https://github.com/google-research/e3x, detailed documentation and usage examples can be found on https://e3x.readthedocs.io.

# Enabling Efficient Equivariant Operations in the Fourier Basis via Gaunt Tensor Products

arXiv:2401.10216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing equivariant neural networks for the E(3) group plays an important role in modeling 3D data across real-world applications. Enforcing this equivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such operations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients, the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication between spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be efficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms. This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of irreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, which serves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations across different model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and 3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improved performance of our approach.

Abstract: Turbulent diffusion causes particles placed in proximity to separate. We investigate the required swimming efforts to maintain an active particle close to its passively advected counterpart. We explore optimally balancing these efforts by developing a novel physics-informed reinforcement learning strategy and comparing it with prescribed control and physics-agnostic reinforcement learning strategies. Our scheme, coined the actor-physicist, is an adaptation of the actor-critic algorithm in which the neural network parameterized critic is replaced with an analytically derived physical heuristic function, the physicist. We validate the proposed physics-informed reinforcement learning approach through extensive numerical experiments in both synthetic BK and more realistic Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow environments, demonstrating its superiority in controlling particle dynamics when compared to standard reinforcement learning methods.

Abstract: While much attention of neural network methods is devoted to high-dimensional PDE problems, in this work we consider methods designed to work for elliptic problems on domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R} ^d, $ $d=1,2,3$ in association with more standard finite elements. We suggest to connect finite elements and neural network approximations through training, i.e., using finite element spaces to compute the integrals appearing in the loss functionals. This approach, retains the simplicity of classical neural network methods for PDEs, uses well established finite element tools (and software) to compute the integrals involved and it gains in efficiency and accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are stable and furthermore, we establish that the resulting approximations converge to the solutions of the PDE. Numerical results indicating the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithms are presented.

# Math matters or maybe not: An astonishing independence between math and rate of learning in chemistry

## 数学是否重要: 数学与化学学习速度之间惊人的独立性

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-bms6x?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Research spanning nearly a century has found that math plays an important role in the learning of chemistry. Here, we use a large dataset of student interactions with online courseware to investigate the details of this link between math and chemistry. The activities in the courseware are labeled against a list of knowledge components (KCs) covered by the content, and student interactions are tracked over a full semester of general chemistry at a range of institutions. Logistic regression is used to model student performance as a function of the number of opportunities a student has taken to engage with a particular KC. This regression analysis generates estimates of both the initial knowledge and the learning rate for each student and each KC. Consistent with results from other domains, the initial knowledge varies substantially across students, but the learning rate is nearly the same for all students. The role of math is investigated by labeling each KC with the level of math involved. The overwhelming result from regressions based on these labels is that only the initial knowledge varies strongly across students and across the level of math involved in a particular topic. The student learning rate is nearly independent of both the level of math involved in a KC and the prior mathematical preparation of an individual student. The observation that the primary challenge for students lies in initial knowledge, rather than learning rate, may have implications for course and curriculum design.

Investigating nucleation in charged nanoconfined environments is crucial for many scientific and engineering applications. Here we under electric fields is essential for the design of materials. We study the nucleation of NaCl from aqueous solution near charged surfaces using machine-learning-augmented enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations successfully drive phase transitions between liquid and solid phases of NaCl. The solid phase is stabilized under electric fields, particularly at an intermediate surface charge density. We examine which physical characteristics drive the nucleation of NaCl from aqueous solutions and find that the removal of solvent water from Cl- at the solid precursor surface plays a more critical role than the accumulation of ions. Our simulations reveal the competing effects of electric fields on nucleation processes: they facilitate the removal of water, promoting nucleation, but also promote the separation of ion pairs thereby hindering nucleation. This work provides a framework for studying nucleation processes in nanoconfined environments under electric fields and physical insights for the design of electrochemistry materials.

The ubiquity of C–H bonds in organic molecules makes C–H functionalisation one of the most valuable synthetic transformations in organic chemistry. It provides a sustainable synthetic strategy, optimising atom and step economy by eliminating the need for functional handles, instead relying on reagent control or the substrate’s innate selectivity. C–H alkylation of electron-poor aromatic species remains a particular challenge, typically relying on functional handles to direct selectivity with either traditional palladium cross-coupling or nickel photoredox methodologies. Here we introduce a highly selective, scalable, and cost effective synthetic strategy for C–H alkylation of electron-poor aromatics, exhibiting high
functional group tolerance applicable to pharmaceutical compounds. This reaction leverages an autocatalytic, electron donor-acceptor triggered, radical reaction, as confirmed by both experimental and computational analyses. Notably, it demonstrates ‘anti-Friedel-Crafts’
selectivity, consistent with theoretical predictions from Fukui indices and machine learning models on previously ‘unseen’ substrates.

Doping guest elements is an effective way to increase activity and stability of RuO2 catalysts in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, due to the vastness of doping space, it is challenging for either high-cost experiments or density functional theory (DFT) calculations to screen out the doped structures with the optimized catalytic performance. Herein, we reported a machine-learning (ML) framework that aims to realize high-throughput screening for both stability and activity of doped-RuO2 acidic OER catalysts from mono-doping to triple-doping at a low level of computational cost. Compared to the d-band theory and some other previous models, our ML model was constructed based on more general input features and realized higher prediction accuracy with mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.074, 0.142 and 0.082 eV for *OH, *O and *OOH adsorption, respectively. Through the ML models, three doping structures, Ru41Zn7O96, Ru41Zn4Fe3O96, and Ru39Zn4Cu4Co1O96 were found to possess the extraordinarily high stability and comparable or higher activity than the previously reported OER catalysts. This work provided an efficient study paradigm in fields of material screening and a useful guide for experimental synthesis.

Panoramic driving perception systems are critical for autonomous driving, as they provide essential traffic-related information. This study introduces AppNets, an efficient and effective multi-task learning framework designed for real-time panoptic driving perception. AppNets comprises an encoder for feature extraction and three decoders that concurrently perform traffic object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane segmentation. We propose the C2fA module to enhance the model's extraction capability. To enhance our dataset, we expanded the SDExpressway dataset by adding 2,000 frames, particularly incorporating nighttime and adverse weather scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted on both the challenging BDD100K dataset and the augmented SDExpressway dataset demonstrate that AppNets achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming baseline models by significant margins. Specifically, on the SDExpressway dataset, AppNets attains a mean average precision (mAP) of 85.1% for traffic object detection, a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 98.7% for drivable area segmentation, and an intersection over union (IoU) of 75.1% for lane segmentation. These results underscore the effectiveness of AppNets in complex driving scenarios, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in autonomous driving systems. the source codes are released at https://github.com/Huniki/Appnet.git

## 致密砂岩储层多层感知与多变量时间序列智能岩相识别方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5076410/latest

Lithofacies classification and identification are of great significance in the exploration and evaluation of tight sandstone reservoirs. Existing methods of lithofacies identification in tight sandstone reservoirs face issues such as lengthy manual classification, strong subjectivity of identification, and insufficient sample datasets, which make it challenging to analyze the lithofacies characteristics of these reservoirs during oil and gas exploration. In this paper, the Fuyu oil formation in the Songliao Basin is selected as the target area, and an intelligent method for recognizing the lithophysics reservoirs in tight sandstone based on hybrid multilayer perceptron (MLP) and multivariate time series (MTS-Mixers) is proposed. Firstly, appropriate logging curve parameters are selected based on the contribution rate as the basis of the lithofacies intelligent discrimination. Second, preprocessing operations are performed on the logging dataset to ensure the quality of the experimental data. Finally, the MLP-MTS hybrid intelligent model is constructed by combining the powerful information extraction and classification recognition capabilities of the MLP and MTS models to complete the intelligent recognition of the petrography of tight sandstone reservoirs. The experimental results demonstrate that the recognition efficiency of MLP-MTS model for all kinds of lithofacies phases is more than 90%, which verifies the good applicability of deep learning model in solving the process of lithofacies phase recognition in reservoirs.

# A perspective on interdisciplinary learning supported by a systems thinking approach in STEM education

## STEM教育中系统思维方法支持的跨学科学习透视

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5368464/latest

Real-world problems are traditionally viewed through a disciplinary lens at the boundary of the physical, life, mathematical and chemical sciences. The existence of these boundaries in taught classroom courses from a traditional context may be an intellectual barrier in seeking critically important hidden connectivities for problems that may have a multidisciplinary origin. Re-shaping STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education requires greater conceptual engagement across the four foundational pillars (i.e. Chemistry, Physics, Math and Biology) with a greater appreciation of the underlying principles connecting the fundamental sciences in STEM. From this perspective, there is little insight in the intuitive approach to solving multi-disciplinary problems by students from diverse disciplinary backgrounds at the university level. Based on the current rationale, a diverse student cohort from the arts, engineering and education sectors and from the social, natural and life sciences disciplines were invited to participate in a survey designed to engage students in applying key concepts embedded in &amp;lsquo;systems thinking&amp;rsquo; through deeper explorations of complex interrelationships. We developed a difficulty index (D.I), which was an effective parameter in distinguishing between &amp;lsquo;system&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;non-system&amp;rsquo; thinking&amp;rsquo; approaches by the tested students to decision making when confronted with unfamiliar complex problems. Pre-attentive processing of given data was critical in guiding and shaping data perception and problem solving. More than half (55.2%) of the tested student correctly identified relationships at the observational level to adequately interpret a probable system of interconnecting elements in their analysis. A slow but progressive awareness in the conceptuality of systems and parts and their underlying relationships increased the performance during the course of the survey in the range of (72.4&amp;ndash;97.6%). While understanding the complex phenomena of &amp;lsquo;emergent properties&amp;rsquo; was unsurprisingly low, a mental effort in the recognition of behavioral patterns and the influence of external physical, chemical and biological factors was supported by increased D.I scoring, although a cognitive bias could not be ruled out.

Since the proliferation of Android malware has posed a major threat to mobile security in recent years, robust detection solutions need to be created. The main tool being utilized in this research to detect Android malware is app permissions. Information about the permissions that Android applications request is the primary signal in the dataset for distinguishing between malicious and benign applications. Through the use of a machine learning model developed by analyzing the connection between specific permissions and malware activity, apps are categorized as either safe or possibly dangerous. By using supervised learning approaches to evaluate the prediction potential of permission patterns, the proposed method offers a portable and efficient malware detection solution. Experimental results show that the model may accurately detect malware, providing a potential avenue to enhance permission-based Android security solutions.

# Turkish Adaptation Study Of Fear Of Water Assessment Scale And Its Analysis In Terms Of Various Variables

## 土耳其对水的恐惧评估量表的适应性研究及其各种变量的分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5344980/latest

Fear of water is the main indicator of a lack of weakness of swimming ability. Some people cannot learn how to swim because they avoid water completely, while others might have difficulty learning because they may not relax their bodies while swimming. Thus, it is necessity to recognize these individuals and develop effective teaching strategies for them. Teachers and swim coaches need an assessment tool to help them identify individuals who are afraid of water. The aim of this study was to adapt the Fear of Water Assessment Questionnaire (FWAQ) developed by Misimi and co-worker (2020) into Turkish. For adaptation, the original scale was translated into Turkish. 146 males (54.5%) and 122 females (45.5%), participated in the study. The FWAQ consists of 20 items and three subscales: contact with the water environment, the natural power of water, and the values of movement control in water. Cronbach's alpha, interclass correlation coefficient (ICC), confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis was used to determine the internal consistency of subscales, temporal reliability, construct validity of the scale respectively. Also, the results of the calculations performed to estimate the reliability of the scale factors show that the value of the Cronbach's alpha coefficient and interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) are good enough and considering that the internal consistency coefficients and temporal reliability of the components of the list are reasonable and appropriate, the reliability of the scale is confirmed. The results revealed that FWAQ showed relatively acceptable construct validity and acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The results of this study support the preliminary validity and reliability of the FWAQ for use in academic sport contexts.

## 基于仿真数据集的迁移学习策略优化热丝激光金属沉积工艺预测模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5274598/latest

This study addresses the challenge of predicting and controlling melt pool behavior in Hot-Wire Laser Metal Deposition (HW-LMD) technology by proposing a transfer learning strategy based on simulation datasets to optimize process parameter prediction. First, a large amount of simulated data was generated using a mechanistic model to pre-train a deep neural network (DNN). Then, transfer learning was applied by incorporating actual experimental data to enhance the model's accuracy in predicting process parameters related to melt pool dimensions. The experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly reduces the demand for experimental data and lowers prediction errors. The model trained with traditional methods exhibited an error rate of 21.16%, whereas the error was significantly reduced to 2.03% after optimization using the transfer learning strategy based on the simulation dataset. The findings offer a novel approach to process optimization and quality control in the field of additive manufacturing.

## 使用NeuroStack网络进行信用卡欺诈检测，并使用CreditRecHub进行基于风险的个性化推荐

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5332636/latest

The industrial sector suffers annual losses of billions of euros due to Credit card fraud, which has increased with the growth of online communication channels. Cybercriminals are continuously coming up with new ways to use the network for illegal activities. Credit risk prediction methods frequently encounter issues including inconsistent data distribution and challenging data preprocessing. High-precision models are often accompanied by low model efficiency. This study presents a comprehensive framework for credit card fraud detection and personalized recommendation systems. A novel NeuroStack Network is proposed with the assistance acquired from deep learning for credit card fraud detection (CCFD). This model encapsulates the autoencoder, LSTM with attention, and an ensemble of XGBoost and SVM. In terms of risk assessment, we propose a Risk Scoring Model utilizing a Random Forest algorithm combined with Dynamic Risk Adjustment through Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) integrated with a Scaled Dot-Product Attention Mechanism, allowing for adaptive and responsive fraud detection capabilities.The Personalized Recommendation system referred as CreditRecHub is designed by using the adaptive recommendation engine and risk-based recommendation system. The Behavioral Profiling process is optimized using the Hybrid Grey Whale Optimization Algorithm (HGWOA) to enhance the accuracy of user behavior analysis. The accuracy recorded of two datasets such as 0.98843 and 0.99976 provided an accurate result of the intrusion detection.

# Efficient Brain Tumor Detection Based on Channel Shuffling

## 基于通道改组的高效脑肿瘤检测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5127189/latest

Brain tumor detection is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment planning, as it involves automatically identifying and localizing brain tumors. However, existing methods often lack accuracy in detecting highly heterogeneous brain tumors and struggle to balance detection speed. To alleviate these issues, a novel brain tumor detection method termed channel shuffling YOLO (CS-YOLO) has been proposed, which optimizes both accuracy and detection speed. First, a depthwise separable convolution with a channel shuffling RepVGG module is designed. This module combines efficient parameter computation with robust feature extraction. It extracts deep features from images, thereby enhancing both accuracy and speed of brain tumor detection. Second, to enhance the network's performance in perceiving complex brain tumor targets, a novel convolutional multi-head self-attention module is constructed. This module learns long-range dependencies at lower resolutions, thereby improving the model's capability to recognize highly heterogeneous brain tumors. Finally, a lightweight channel shuffling convolution is designed and used to construct a lightweight residual module. This module dramatically reduces the number of parameters and the computational complexity of the model by splitting and shuffling channels, thus improving the model's learning and generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses YOLOv6-L, YOLOv7, YOLOv8-L, and the latest RCS-YOLO in terms of detection accuracy and speed on the Br35H dataset. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed CS-YOLO significantly enhances brain tumor detection accuracy and speed. Specifically, network computation in GFLOPs is reduced by 41%, FPS is increased by 14%, and accuracy AP is improved by 0.8%, achieving advanced performance.

# The updated distribution of clay minerals in the World Ocean

## 世界海洋中粘土矿物的最新分布

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5285150/latest

Clay mineral content in marine sediments is central to a wide variety of applications in the marine geosciences, including climate and slope stability. Most studies are not applicable to a global scale, focusing on single locations or regional areas. Additionally, abundant clay mineral species data (Kaolinite, Illite, Smectite, Chlorite) are not curated for &amp;ldquo;big data&amp;rdquo; applications necessary to produce estimates on a global scale. Geospatial machine learning (GML) techniques have successfully produced global predictions of geological seafloor properties, such as sedimentation rate and total organic carbon. Here, we curate observed data of abundant clay mineral percentages for use in a GML algorithm to predict global estimates of relative clay mineral abundances. Our global seafloor clay mineral species predictions are similar to previous global estimates and results show that GML predictions are the best data-driven estimate (~&amp;thinsp;2x decrease in error) of clay mineral percentage where it has not been previously measured.

Over the past few years, there has been significant research on the Internet of Things (IOT), with a major challenge being network security and penetration. Security solutions require careful planning and vigilance to safeguard system security and privacy. Adjusting the weights of neural networks has been shown to improve detection accuracy to some extent. In attack detection, the primary goal is to enhance the precision of attack detection using machine learning techniques. The paper details a fresh approach for adjusting weights in the random neural network to recognize attacks. Reviews of the method under consideration indicate better performance than random neural network methods, Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Up to 99.49% accuracy has been achieved in attack detection, while the random neural network method has improved to 99.01%. The amalgamation of the most effective approaches in these experiments through a multi-learning model led to an accuracy improvement to 99.56%. The proposed model required less training time compared to the random neural network method.

# Relating satellite NO2 tropospheric columns to near-surface concentrations: implications from ground-based MAX-DOAS NO2 vertical profile observations

## 将卫星NO2对流层柱与近地表浓度相关联: 基于地面的max-doas NO2垂直剖面观测的含义

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5338388/latest

Given the significant environmental and health risks associated with near-surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2), machine learning is frequently employed to estimate near-surface NO2 concentrations (SNO2) from satellite-derived tropospheric NO2 column densities (CNO2). However, data-driven methods often face challenges in explaining the complex relationships between these variables. In this study, the correlation between CNO2 and SNO2 is examined using vertical profile observations from China&amp;rsquo;s MAX-DOAS network. Cloud cover and air convection substantially weaken (R = -0.68) and strengthen (R&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.71) the CNO2-SNO2 correlation, respectively. Meteorological factors are shown to predominantly influence the CNO2-SNO2 correlation (R2&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.58), with correlation levels 31% higher in northern regions compared to the southwest. Additionally, anthropogenic emissions impact SNO2, while topographical features shape regional climate patterns. Observations at the Chongqing site reveal notable contrasts and lags in daily CNO2 and SNO2 fluctuations due to complex interactions among adverse meteorology, severe emissions, and basin topography. This study enhances understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics and influencing mechanisms of CNO2 and SNO2, supporting improved air quality assessments and pollution exposure evaluations.

# Efficient Deep Neural Network for Intrusion Detection Using CIC-IDS-2017 Dataset

## 基于CIC-IDS-2017数据集的高效深度神经网络入侵检测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5424062/latest

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential in identifying and reporting potential network attacks. IDS are classified into Host-based IDS (HIDS), which monitor internal computer threats, and Network-based IDS (NIDS), which monitor network-level attacks. IDS can also function as anomaly-based, using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to recognize unfamiliar attack patterns, or as rule-based, which relies on historical data-driven rules. Notably, anomaly-based IDS can detect zero-day attacks. Therefore, this study proposes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for anomaly-based IDS, focusing on accurate and efficient attack detection and categorization using the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset. By optimizing dataset preprocessing, the DNN architecture aims to minimize computational demands while maintaining high accuracy. Comparative evaluation with other models demonstrates the proposed model's effectiveness in attack detection despite using a simpler, more lightweight architecture than those in other studies, where more complex, less efficient approaches are often employed.

# D3A-TS: Denoising-Driven Data Augmentation in Time Series

## D3A-TS: 去噪驱动的时间序列数据增强

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5362988/latest

It has been demonstrated that the amount of data is crucial in data-driven machine learning methods. Data is always valuable, but in some tasks, it is almost like gold. This occurs in engineering areas where data is scarce or very expensive to obtain, such as predictive maintenance, where faults are rare. In this context, a mechanism to generate synthetic data can be very useful. While in fields such as Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing synthetic data generation has been extensively explored with promising results, in other domains such as time series it has received less attention. Previous works have proposed techniques like geometric transformations, interpolation, and generative models like GANs and VAEs for time series data augmentation. However, the use of denoising models, particularly Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs), remains largely unexplored in this context. This work specifically focuses on studying and analyzing the use of different techniques for data augmentation in time series for classification and regression problems. The proposed D3A-TS methodology involves the use of DPMs, which have recently achieved successful results in the field of Image Processing, for data augmentation in time series. Additionally, the use of meta-attributes to condition the data augmentation process is investigated. The results highlight the high utility of this methodology in creating synthetic data to train classification and regression models. To assess the results, six different datasets from diverse domains were employed, showcasing versatility in terms of input size and output types. Finally, an extensive ablation study is conducted to further support the obtained outcomes.

Despite their vulnerable status, manatee conservation eﬀorts are hindered because of limited scientiﬁc data due to the data collection challenges. Bio-acoustic studies utilizing advanced computational analy- sis of long-term recordings oﬀer a promising approach for determining the manatee&rsquo;s presence and abundance. The following manuscript describes an artiﬁcial intelligence pipeline that eﬀectively implements automatic manatee identiﬁcation and counting. The ﬁrst step is ﬁne-tuning a pre- trained deep neuronal network using transfer learning to detect manatee sounds with a binary accuracy of 96%. In the second phase, the pipeline implements an unsupervised learning method to group acoustic fea- tures of the detected sounds with a clustering score of 72%. The article addresses the implications and the outcomes of testing this proof of con- cept under experimental conditions with passive acoustics monitoring data on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica and Panama.

# Visual Emotion Analysis Using Skill-Based Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation

## 基于技能的多教师知识蒸馏的视觉情感分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5415367/latest

The biggest challenge in Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) is bridging the affective gap between the features extracted from an image and the emotion it expresses. It is therefore essential to rely on multiple cues to have decent predictions. Recent approaches use deep learning models to extract rich features in an automated manner, through complex frameworks built with multi-branch convolutional neural networks and fusion or attention modules. This paper explores a different approach, by introducing a three-step training scheme and leveraging Knowledge Distillation (KD), which reconciles effectiveness and simplicity, and thus achieves promising performances despite using a very basic CNN. KD is involved in the first step, where a student model learns to extract the most relevant features on its own, by reproducing those of several teachers specialized in different tasks. The proposed Skill-based Multi-teacher Knowledge Distillation (SMKD) loss also ensures that for each instance, the student focuses more or less on the teachers depending on their capacity to obtain a good prediction, i.e. their relevance. The two remaining steps serve respectively to train the student's classifier and to fine-tune the whole model, both for the VEA task. Experiments on two VEA databases demonstrate the gain in performance offered by our approach, where the students consistently outperform their teachers, and also state-of-the-art methods.

# PIPENN-EMB: ensemble net and protein embeddings generalise protein interface prediction beyond homology

## Pipenn-emb: 集合网络和蛋白质嵌入概括了超越同源性的蛋白质界面预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5367674/latest

Protein interactions are crucial for understanding biological functions and disease mechanisms, but predicting these remains acomplex task in computational biology. Increasingly, Deep Learning models are having success in interface prediction. Thisstudy presents PIPENN-EMB which explores the added value of using embeddings from the ProtT5-XL protein languagemodel. Our results show substantial improvement over the previously published PIPENN model for protein interaction interfaceprediction, reaching an MCC of 0.313 vs. 0.249, and AUC-ROC 0.800 vs. 0.755 on the BIO_DL_TE test set. We furthermoreshow that these embeddings cover a broad range of &lsquo;hand-crafted&rsquo; protein features in ablation studies. PIPENN-EMB reachesstate-of-the-art performance on the ZK448 dataset for protein-protein interface prediction. We showcase predictions on 25resistance-related proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Furthermore, whereas other state-of-the-art sequence-basedmethods perform worse for proteins that have little recognisable homology in their training data, PIPENN-EMB generalises toremote homologs, yielding stable AUC-ROC across all three test sets with less than 30% sequence identity to the trainingdataset, and even to proteins with less than 15% sequence identity.
