# Unsupervised Machine Learning Phase Classification for Falicov-Kimball Model

## Falicov-kimball模型的无监督机器学习阶段分类

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07319

arXiv:2411.07319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply various unsupervised machine learning methods for phase classification to investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model in two dimensions. Using only particle occupation snapshots from Monte Carlo simulations as input, each technique, including a straightforward classification based on principal component analysis (PCA), successfully identifies the phase boundary between ordered and disordered phases, independent of the type of phase transition. Remarkably, these techniques also distinguish between the weakly localized and Anderson-localized regimes within the disordered phase, accurately identifying their crossover, which is a challenging task for standard methods. Among the machine learning approaches used, PCA based analysis outperforms more complex methods, such as neural network predictors and autoencoders. These results underscore the effectiveness of simple unsupervised techniques in examining phase transitions and electron localization in complex correlated systems.

# Modeling Extensive Defects in Metals through Active Machine Learning and Automated Configuration Reconstruction

## 通过主动机器学习和自动配置重建对金属中的广泛缺陷进行建模

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07367

arXiv:2411.07367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended defects such as dislocation networks and complex grain boundaries are ubiquitous in metals, and accurately modeling these extensive defects is crucial for understanding their deformation mechanisms. Existing machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often fall short in adequately describing these defects, as their significant characteristic sizes exceed the computational limits of first-principles calculations. To address these challenges, this study constructs a comprehensive defect genome, derived through active machine learning from classical empirical potentials, and augmented by conventional on-the-fly active learning. Additionally, we have developed a approach for transforming defect atomic clusters into periodic configurations via precise atom insertion, using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations. These strategies enable the development of highly accurate and transferable MLIPs for modeling extensive defects in metals. Using body-centered cubic tungsten as a model system, we develop an MLIP that reveals previously undocumented plastic mechanisms in simulations of nanoindentation and dislocation-grain boundary interactions. This framework not only improves the modeling accuracy of extensive defects in crystalline materials but also establishes a robust foundation for further advancement of MLIP development through the strategic use of defect genomes.

# Defect formation in CsSnI$_3$ from Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07448

arXiv:2411.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sn-based perovskites as low-toxic materials are actively studied for optoelectronic applications. However, their performance is limited by $p$-type self-doping, which can be suppressed by substitutional doping on the cation sites. In this study, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with machine learning (ML) to develop a predictive model and identify the key descriptors affecting formation energy and charge transition levels of the substitutional dopants in CsSnI$_{3}$. Our DFT calculations create a dataset of formation energies and charge transition levels and show that Y, Sc, Al, Nb, Ba, and Sr are effective dopants that pin the fermi level higher in the band gap, suppressing the $p$-type self-doping. We explore ML algorithms and propose training the random forest regression model to predict the defect formation properties. This work shows the predictive capability of combining DFT with machine learning and provides insights into the important features that determine the defect formation energetics.

# Predicting Ti-Al Binary Phase Diagram with an Artificial Neural Network Potential

## 用人工神经网络势预测ti-al二元相图

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07960

arXiv:2411.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microstructure of the Ti-Al binary system is an area of great interest as it affects material properties and plasticity. Phase transformations induce microstructural changes; therefore, accurately modeling the phase transformations of the Ti-Al system is necessary to describe plasticity. Interatomic potentials can be a powerful tool to model how materials behave; however, existing potentials lack accuracy in certain aspects. While classical potentials like the Embedded Atom Method (EAM) and Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) perform adequately for modeling dilute Al solute within Ti's $\alpha$ phase, they struggle with accurately predicting plasiticity. In particular, they struggle with stacking fault energies in intermetallics and to some extent elastic properties. This hinders their effectiveness in investigating the plastic behavior of formed intermetallics in Ti-Al alloys. Classical potentials also fail to predict the $\alpha$ to $\beta$ phase boundary. Existing machine learning (ML) potentials reproduce the properties of formed intermetallics with density functional theory (DFT) but do not examine the $\alpha$ to $\beta$ or $\alpha$ to D0$_{19}$ phase boundaries. This work uses a rapid artificial neural network (RANN) framework to produce a neural network potential for the Ti-Al binary system. This potential is capable of reproducing the Ti-Al binary phase diagram up to 50$\%$ Al concentration. The present interatomic potential ensures stability and allows results near the accuracy of DFT. Using Monte Carlo simulations, RANN potential accurately predicts the $\alpha$ to $\beta$ and $\alpha$ to D0$_{19}$ phase transitions. The current potential also exhibits accurate elastic constants and stacking fault energies for the L1$_0$ and D0$_{19}$ phases.

# Generating and analyzing small-size datasets to explore physical observables in quantum Ising systems

## 生成和分析小型数据集，以探索量子Ising系统中的物理可观察量

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07701

arXiv:2411.07701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a detailed analysis of datasets generated from simulations of two-dimensional quantum spin systems using the quantum Ising model at absolute zero temperature. Our focus is on examining how fundamental physical properties, energy, magnetization, and entanglement entropy, evolve under varying external transverse magnetic fields and system sizes. From the Quantum Toolbox in Python (QuTiP), we simulate systems with 4, 8, and 16 spins arranged in square lattices, generating extensive datasets with 5000 samples per magnetic field value. The Hamiltonian operator incorporates quantum mechanical effects such as superposition and tunneling, challenging classical interpretations of spin states. We compute extended Pauli operators and construct the Hamiltonian to include spin-spin interactions and transverse field terms. Our analysis reveals that as the system size increases, fluctuations in energy and entanglement entropy become more evident, indicating lifted sensitivity to external perturbations and suggesting the onset of quantum phase transitions. Spin-spin correlation functions demonstrate that interactions are predominantly local, but larger systems exhibit more complex and fluctuating correlations. These findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of quantum spin systems and lay the groundwork for future machine learning applications aimed at predicting physical quantities and identifying phase transitions from a quantum perspective.

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06975

arXiv:2306.06975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SCALINN -- Strongly Correlated Approach with Language Inspired Neural Network -- as a method for solving the Anderson impurity model and reducing the computational cost of dynamical mean-field theory calculations. Inspired by the success of generative Transformer networks in natural language processing, SCALINN utilizes an in-house modified Transformer network in order to learn correlated Matsubara Green's functions, which act as solutions to the impurity model. This is achieved by providing the network with low-cost Matsubara Green's functions, thereby overcoming the computational cost of high accuracy solutions. Across different temperatures and interaction strengths, the performance of SCALINN is demonstrated in both physical observables (spectral function, Matsubara Green's functions, quasi-particle weight), and the mean squared error cost values of the neural network, showcasing the network's ability to accelerate Green's function based calculations of correlated materials.

Abstract: We investigate numerically the identification of relevant structural features that contribute to the dynamical heterogeneity in a model glass-forming liquid. By employing the recently proposed information imbalance technique, we select these features from a range of physically motivated descriptors. This selection process is performed in a supervised manner (using both dynamical and structural data) and an unsupervised manner (using only structural data). We then apply the selected features to predict future dynamics using a machine learning technique. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of this approach in identifying the dominant mechanisms governing the glassy slow dynamics.

# Memory-Augmented Hybrid Quantum Reservoir Computing

## 内存增强的混合量子库计算

arXiv:2409.09886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is an effective method for predicting chaotic systems by using a high-dimensional dynamic reservoir with fixed internal weights, while keeping the learning phase linear, which simplifies training and reduces computational complexity compared to fully trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) uses the exponential growth of Hilbert spaces in quantum systems, allowing for greater information processing, memory capacity, and computational power. However, the original QRC proposal requires coherent injection of inputs multiple times, complicating practical implementation. We present a hybrid quantum-classical approach that implements memory through classical post-processing of quantum measurements. This approach avoids the need for multiple coherent input injections and is evaluated on benchmark tasks, including the chaotic Mackey-Glass time series prediction. We tested our model on two physical platforms: a fully connected Ising model and a Rydberg atom array. The optimized model demonstrates promising predictive capabilities, achieving a higher number of steps compared to previously reported approaches.

# KH-PINN: Physics-informed neural networks for Kelvin-Helmholtz instability with spatiotemporal and magnitude multiscale

## Kh-pinn: 具有时空和幅度多尺度的开尔文-亥姆霍兹不稳定性的物理通知神经网络

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07524

arXiv:2411.07524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is crucial across various fields, requiring extensive high-fidelity data. However, experimental data are often sparse and noisy, while simulated data may lack credibility due to discrepancies with real-world configurations and parameters. This underscores the need for field reconstruction and parameter inference from sparse, noisy data, which constitutes inverse problems. Based on the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the KH-PINN framework is established in this work to solve the inverse problems of KHI flows. By incorporating the governing physical equations, KH-PINN reconstructs continuous flow fields and infer unknown transport parameters from sparse, noisy observed data. The 2D unsteady incompressible flows with both constant and variable densities are studied. To our knowledge, this is the first application of PINNs to unsteady incompressible flows with variable densities. To address the spatiotemporal multiscale issue and enhance the reconstruction accuracy of small-scale structures, the multiscale embedding (ME) strategy is adopted. To address the magnitude multiscale issue and enhance the reconstruction accuracy of small-magnitude velocities, which are critical for KHI problems, the small-velocity amplification (SVA) strategy is proposed. The results demonstrate that KH-PINN can accurately reconstruct the fields with complex, evolving vortices and infer unknown parameters across a broad range of Reynolds numbers. Additionally, the energy-decaying and entropy-increasing curves are accurately obtained. The effectiveness of ME and SVA is validated through comparative studies, and the anti-noise and few-shot learning capabilities of KH-PINN are also validated. The code for this work is available at https://github.com/CAME-THU/KH-PINN.

Abstract: Super-resolution ultrasound (SR-US) is a powerful imaging technique for capturing microvasculature and blood flow at high spatial resolution. However, accurate microbubble (MB) localization remains a key challenge, as errors in localization can propagate through subsequent stages of the super-resolution process, affecting overall performance. In this paper, we explore the potential of ensemble learning techniques to enhance MB localization by increasing detection sensitivity and reducing false positives. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of ensemble methods on both in vivo and simulated outputs of a Deformable DEtection TRansformer (Deformable DETR) network. As a result of our study, we are able to demonstrate the advantages of these ensemble approaches by showing improved precision and recall in MB detection and offering insights into their application in SR-US.

Abstract: Objective: Ensuring the precision in motion tracking for MRI-guided Radiotherapy (MRIgRT) is crucial for the delivery of effective treatments. This study refined the motion tracking accuracy in MRIgRT through the innovation of an automatic real-time tracking method, leveraging an enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection (ETLD) framework coupled with automatic segmentation. Methods: We developed a novel MRIgRT motion tracking method by integrating two primary methods: the ETLD framework and an improved Chan-Vese model (ICV), named ETLD+ICV. The TLD framework was upgraded to suit real-time cine MRI, including advanced image preprocessing, no-reference image quality assessment, an enhanced median-flow tracker, and a refined detector with dynamic search region adjustments. Additionally, ICV was combined for precise coverage of the target volume, which refined the segmented region frame by frame using tracking results, with key parameters optimized. Tested on 3.5D MRI scans from 10 patients with liver metastases, our method ensures precise tracking and accurate segmentation vital for MRIgRT. Results: An evaluation of 106,000 frames across 77 treatment fractions revealed sub-millimeter tracking errors of less than 0.8mm, with over 99% precision and 98% recall for all subjects, underscoring the robustness and efficacy of the ETLD. Moreover, the ETLD+ICV yielded a dice global score of more than 82% for all subjects, demonstrating the proposed method's extensibility and precise target volume coverage. Conclusions: This study successfully developed an automatic real-time motion tracking method for MRIgRT that markedly surpasses current methods. The novel method not only delivers exceptional precision in tracking and segmentation but also demonstrates enhanced adaptability to clinical demands, positioning it as an indispensable asset in the quest to augment the efficacy of radiotherapy treatments.

# Simulating Quantum Many-Body States with Neural-Network Exponential Ansatz

## 用神经网络指数Ansatz模拟量子多体态

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07886

arXiv:2411.07886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing quantum many-body states on classical or quantum devices is a very challenging task that requires accounting for exponentially large Hilbert spaces. Although this complexity can be managed with exponential ans\"atze (such as in the coupled-cluster method), these approaches are often tailored to specific systems, which limits their universality. Recent work has shown that the contracted Schr\"odinger equation enables the construction of universal, formally exact exponential ans\"atze for quantum many-body physics. However, while the ansatz is capable of resolving arbitrary quantum systems, it still requires a full calculation of its parameters whenever the underlying Hamiltonian changes, even slightly. Here, inspired by recent progress in operator learning, we develop a surrogate neural network solver that generates the exponential ansatz parameters using the Hamiltonian parameters as inputs, eliminating the need for repetitive computations. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach by training neural networks of several quantum many-body systems, including the Fermi-Hubbard model.

# Isometric Transformations for Image Augmentation in Mueller Matrix Polarimetry

## Mueller矩阵极化法中用于图像增强的等距变换

arXiv:2411.07918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mueller matrix polarimetry captures essential information about polarized light interactions with a sample, presenting unique challenges for data augmentation in deep learning due to its distinct structure. While augmentations are an effective and affordable way to enhance dataset diversity and reduce overfitting, standard transformations like rotations and flips do not preserve the polarization properties in Mueller matrix images. To this end, we introduce a versatile simulation framework that applies physically consistent rotations and flips to Mueller matrices, tailored to maintain polarization fidelity. Our experimental results across multiple datasets reveal that conventional augmentations can lead to misleading results when applied to polarimetric data, underscoring the necessity of our physics-based approach. In our experiments, we first compare our polarization-specific augmentations against real-world captures to validate their physical consistency. We then apply these augmentations in a semantic segmentation task, achieving substantial improvements in model generalization and performance. This study underscores the necessity of physics-informed data augmentation for polarimetric imaging in deep learning (DL), paving the way for broader adoption and more robust applications across diverse research in the field. In particular, our framework unlocks the potential of DL models for polarimetric datasets with limited sample sizes. Our code implementation is available at github.com/hahnec/polar_augment.

# Propensity of water self-ions at air(oil)-water interfaces revealed by deep potential molecular dynamics with enhanced sampling

Abstract: The preference of water self-ions (hydronium and hydroxide) towards air/oil-water interfaces is one of the hottest topics in water research due to its importance for understanding properties, phenomena, and reactions of interfaces. In this work, we performed enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations based on state-of-the-art neural network potentials with approximate M06-2X accuracy to investigate the propensity of hydronium and hydroxide ions at air/oil(decane)-water interfaces, which can simultaneously describe well the water autoionization process forming these ions, recombination of ions, and ionic distribution along the normal distance to the interface by employing a set of appropriate Voronoi collective variables. A stable ionic double-layer distribution is observed near the air-water interface, while the distribution is different at oil-water interfaces, where hydronium tends to be repelled from the interface into the bulk water, whereas hydroxide, with an interfacial stabilization free energy of -0.6 kcal/mol, is enriched in the interfacial layer. Through simulations of oil droplets in water, we further reveal that the interfacial propensity of hydroxide ions is caused by the positive charge distribution of the oil-water interface contributed by hydrogens of the dangling OH bonds of interfacial water layer and the outmost layer decane molecules laying flat on the droplet. The present results may aid in understanding the acid-base nature of water interfaces with wide applications.

Abstract: Detectors at future high energy colliders will face enormous technical challenges. Disentangling the unprecedented numbers of particles expected in each event will require highly granular silicon pixel detectors with billions of readout channels. With event rates as high as 40 MHz, these detectors will generate petabytes of data per second. To enable discovery within strict bandwidth and latency constraints, future trackers must be capable of fast, power efficient, and radiation hard data-reduction at the source. We are developing a radiation hard readout integrated circuit (ROIC) in 28nm CMOS with on-chip machine learning (ML) for future intelligent pixel detectors. We will show track parameter predictions using a neural network within a single layer of silicon and hardware tests on the first tape-outs produced with TSMC. Preliminary results indicate that reading out featurized clusters from particles above a modest momentum threshold could enable using pixel information at 40 MHz.

Chemical reaction conditions capable of producing high yields over diverse reactants will be a key component of future self driving labs. While much work has been done to discover general reaction conditions, any single conditions are necessarily limited over increasingly diverse chemical spaces. A potential solution to this problem is to identify small sets of complementary reaction conditions that, when combined, cover a much larger chemical space than any one general reaction condition. In this work, we analyze experimentally derived datasets to assess the relative performance of individual general reaction conditions vs sets of complementary reaction conditions. We then propose and benchmark active learning methods to efficiently discover these complimentary sets of conditions. The results show the value of active learning in exploring sets of reaction conditions and provide an avenue for improving synthetic hit rates in high-throughput synthesis campaigns.

# Graph neural network for 3-dimensional structures including dihedral angles for molecular property prediction

## 用于分子性质预测的包括二面角的3维结构的图神经网络

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-jlwh5?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

The prediction of molecular properties using graph neural network (GNN) based approaches has attracted great attention in recent years. Topological molecular graphs are commonly used for representing molecules in machine learning (ML). However, the challenge is to utilize the complete geometry information, like, bonds, angles and dihedral angles while processing a molecular graph. In this work we present predictive GNN accounting three-dimensional molecular structures including the dihedral angles (GNN3Dihed) in a systematic manner. Additionally, we demonstrate that the usage of autoencoders to generate latent space embeddings for usually sparse atomic and bond vectors reduces the number of parameters in the message passing stage while not reducing performance. We compare the performance of GNN3Dihed with state-of-the-art baselines on several tasks (regression and classification), e.g., solubility prediction, toxicity prediction, binding affinity, and quantum mechanical property prediction, and showed that the present architecture often outperforms other models–demonstrating the importance of 3D structural information for ML in chemistry.

However, determining the surface coverage and distribution of a molecular catalyst on a solid support is often challenging, inhibiting our ability to design improved catalytic systems. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and image analysis of the individual positions of heavy atoms in transition metal complexes via a convolutional neural network (CNN) allows statistically robust determination of the surface coverage and distribution of immobilized molecular catalysts. These observations provide information about how changes in the functionalization conditions, attachment group, and structure of the molecular catalyst affect the surface coverage and distribution, providing insight into the chemical mechanism of surface immobilization. The method could be generally valuable for correlating the surface coverage and distribution to the activity, selectivity, and stability of a catalytic system.

## Esw-yolo: 一种用于瓶装酒缺陷检测的轻量级YOLO模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5369988/latest

With the growing adoption of deep learning in AI, flaw detection in bottled liquor production has become crucial to ensure product quality and consumer satisfaction. However, existing flaw detection models often face issues of low efficiency, particularly in multi-category and multi-target scenarios, and struggle with integration into resource-constrained devices. To solve these challenges, this study proposes ESW-YOLO, a lightweight model optimized to detect diverse flaws in bottled liquor production. This model is designed as follows: firstly, the Efficient Multi-Branch \&amp;amp; Scale FPN (EMBSFPN) is developed to reduce model size while increasing the detection accuracy of small flaws. Secondly, the SE attention mechanism is incorporated to emphasize critical features, which strengthens the model&amp;rsquo;s robustness in complex scenarios. Thirdly, the Wise-IoU loss function is used to optimize localization accuracy, particularly for irregular defects. Finally, a lightweight shared convolutional detection head (ESCD) is proposed to further decrease model size and improve detection efficiency. Experimental results on a bottled liquor flaw detection dataset demonstrate that ESW-YOLO achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 94.7% and a recall of 91.8%. Additionally, the proposed model reduces computational cost by 30.8%, decreases parameter count by 45.1%, and maintains a compact model size of only 3.6 M. This method can provide a reference for the development of defect detection methods in bottled liquor.

## Fde-net: 基于轻量级网络深度和3D包围盒估计的高效移动机器人导航

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5288355/latest

Precise and sturdy three-dimensional object detection (3DOD) presents a promising opportunity within the realm of mobile robot (MR) navigation. Monocular 3DOD techniques often involve extending existing 2D object detection (2DOD) frameworks to predict the 3D bounding box (3DBB) of objects captured in 2D RGB images. Nonetheless, these methods demand multiple images, making them less feasible for a variety of real-time scenarios. To ease these challenges, the rise of nimble convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capable of inferring depth from a sole image opens a fresh path for investigation. The current study introduces a nimble FDENet net-work designed to produce the cost-effective 3D Bounding Box Estimation (3D-BBE) from a single image. The novel framework comprises the PP-LCNet as the encoder and a fast convolution decode as the decoder. Moreover, this fusion integrates a Squeeze-Exploit (SE) module using the MKLDNN optimizer to boost convolutional efficiency and enhance model size streamlining with effective training. Meanwhile, the proposed multi-scale sub-pixel nimble decoder generates top-notch depth maps while upholding a nimble structure. Furthermore, the produced depth maps effectively offer a straightforward perspective with distance details of items within the surroundings. The depth insights are melded with 2DOD for precise evaluation of 3D Bounding Box (3DBB), facilitating scene comprehension and optimal route planning for mobile robots. Based on obtained 3DBB&amp;rsquo;s object center estimation, the optimal MR&amp;rsquo;s obstacle avoidance strategy is completely designed. Experimental outcomes showcase that our model attains cutting-edge performance levels across three datasets of NYU-V2, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Overall, this framework exhibits tremendous potential for adaptation into intelligent mechatronic systems, especially in crafting knowledge-driven systems for MR navigation.

# CalciumZero: A Toolbox for Fluorescence Calcium Imaging on iPSC Derived Brain Organoids

## CalciumZero: iPSC衍生的脑类器官的荧光钙成像工具箱

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5364872/latest

Calcium plays an important role in regulating various neuronal activities in human brains. Investigating the dynamics of the calcium level in neurons is essential not just for understanding the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders but also as a quantitative gauge to evaluate the influence of drugs on neuron activities. Accessing human brain tissue to study neuron activities has historically been challenging due to ethical concerns. However, a significant breakthrough in the field has emerged with the advent of utilizing patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to culture neurons and develop brain organoids. This innovative approach provides a promising modeling system to overcome these critical obstacles. Many robust calcium imaging analysis tools have been developed for calcium activity analysis. However, most of the tools are designed for calcium signal detection only. There are limited choices for in-depth downstream applications, particularly in discerning differences between patient and normal calcium dynamics and their responses to drug treatment obtained from human iPSC-based models.Moreover, end-user researchers usually face a considerable challenge in mastering the entire analysis procedure and obtaining critical outputs due to the steep learning curve associated with these available tools. Therefore, we developed CalciumZero, a user-friendly toolbox to satisfy the unmet needs in calcium activity studies in human iPSC-based 3D-organoid/neurosphere models. CalciumZero includes a graphical user interface (GUI), which provides end-user iconic visualization and smooth adjustments on parameter tuning. It streamlines the entire analysis process, offering full automation with just one click after parameter optimization. In addition, it includes supplementary features to statistically evaluate the impact on disease etiology and the detection of drug candidate effects on calcium activities. These evaluations will enhance the analysis of imaging data obtained from patient iPSC-derived brain organoid/neurosphere models, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the results.

# The effect of Self-Directed Learning Readiness on Thai medical students&rsquo; self-reported National Licensing Examination Step 1 score

## 自我导向学习准备对泰国医学生自我报告的国家许可考试步骤1得分的影响

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5369545/latest

Background Self-directed learning (SDL) is essential for medical students to adapt to continuous learning demands in clinical practice. Problem-based learning (PBL) has been widely used in Thailand&amp;rsquo;s medical education to foster SDL skills. Yet, limited research exists on how specific SDL components relate to academic success, particularly performance on the National Licensing Examination Step 1 (NLE1). This study examines associations between SDL readiness and self-reported NLE1 scores among Thai medical students.Methods In this cross-sectional study, 108 fourth- and fifth-year medical students at the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, completed the Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS), assessing components such as self-management, willingness to learn, and self-control. Additionally, students completed the Time Management Questionnaire (TMQ). Self-reported NLE1 scores were collected as a measure of academic performance. Multiple linear regression was conducted to explore associations between SDL components and NLE1 scores, and Cohen&amp;rsquo;s Kappa was used to assess alignment between perceived and actual SDL readiness.Results Among the SDL components, only self-management skills were significantly associated with higher self-reported NLE1 scores (p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.005). Moderate agreement (Cohen&amp;rsquo;s Kappa&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.41) was found between students&amp;rsquo; perceived SDL readiness and actual SDL readiness scores, indicating that those perceiving themselves as SDL-ready tended to perform better on the NLE1. Although time management was common among SDL-ready students, it did not directly correlate with NLE1 scores.Discussion Our findings highlight self-management as the SDL component most closely associated with academic performance in medical students. This suggests that fostering self-management skills, including decision-making, resource utilization, and action planning, could enhance students&amp;rsquo; academic competencies. The moderate agreement between perceived and actual SDL readiness also suggests that self-awareness plays a role in SDL effectiveness. Encouraging self-reflective practices and providing feedback on students' self-assessments could help bridge the gap between perception and reality. Future research might examine these relationships longitudinally or across diverse educational settings to clarify SDL&amp;rsquo;s broader impacts on academic outcomes.

# The processing for label noise based on attribute reduction and two-step method

## 基于属性约简和两步法的标签噪声处理

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5122434/latest

Classification is a mainstream task in machine learning. To achieve good classification results, there are many aspects to consider. Among them, label noise is the most direct and fundamental problem. Nowadays research targets the processing of label noise in numerous aspects, including correction, filtering and enhanced robustness methods. All these methods have improved the classification accuracy to some extent. However, the above studies consider only one approach to label noise, such as solely focusing on filtering or exclusively on correction. Label noise is complex and it is singular to consider only one method to deal with it. For example, contaminated data in a certain class and noise belonging to this class, both belong to the label noise problems, but with completely different distributions and treatments. This requires us to discuss the situations separately and to propose different processes. In this paper, we take this into account and propose a noise processing method that combines revision and filtration (RF). The RF method can follow the different distributions of label noise and perform targeted processes, which is more effective and comprehensive. It can maintain the original data distribution and remove noise as much as possible. On the other hand, high-dimensional datasets are encountered when dealing with label noise. The attribute values of the dataset will be abnormal due to the presence of label noise. Therefore, we suggest an attribute reduction method for the case when label noise exists. The advantage is that it not only removes redundant attributes, but also eliminates attributes interfered with by noise, which is suitable for high-dimensional data with label noise. Experiments prove that our proposed RF algorithm is effective among three classifiers with multiple comparison algorithms. Performing attribute reduction also improves classification accuracy significantly.

In power line inspections, detecting insulator defects is critical due to the potential breakdown and damage resulting from long-term exposure to the natural environment. However, challenges persist in practical detection processes, such as scarce insulator defect images, difficulty detecting minor defects, and high memory consumption of deep learning models. We propose an insulator defect detection algorithm based on adaptive feature fusion and the lightweight YOLOv5s model to address these issues. First, we enhance the existing dataset by employing techniques like flipping, random pixel manipulation, noise addition, and contrast/brightness adjustments to increase the diversity of training samples. Next, we integrate the adaptive feature fusion (ASFF) module to enable the network to learn relationships between different feature maps, enhancing semantic information and improving the network's ability to detect minor defects. Finally, we replace the backbone of YOLOv5s with the lightweight convolutional neural network EfficientNet, making the network more efficient and enabling it to focus more on target features. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in insulator defect detection. The model achieves an accuracy rate of 96.4%, a recall rate of 96.1%, and an mAP of 97.6%, effectively enhancing network performance.

## 使用fMRI BOLD信号的时频频谱图和机器学习推进ASD诊断分类

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5170177/latest

In this study, our goal was to develop a diagnostic framework for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by analyzing time-frequency spectrograms generated from BOLD signals in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We used fMRI data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database and performed brain parcellation with Gordon&amp;rsquo;s, Harvard-Oxford, and Diedrichsen atlases. Time-frequency spectrograms were generated from the average time series of each region of interest (ROI) using methods like short-time Fourier transform, continuous wavelet transform, Mel frequency cepstrum (MFC), and smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution. From these spectrograms, we extracted various features, including the grey-level co-occurrence matrix, grey-level run-length matrix, fractal dimension texture analysis, Zernike moments, Hu moments, and first-order statistics. To evaluate the diagnostic model, we applied machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting, and random forest, alongside recursive feature elimination with 5-fold cross-validation (RFECV) and hyperparameter tuning. The SVM classifier using MFC spectrograms and RFECV yielded the highest performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 95.71%, sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 91.42%, F1-score of 95.76%, and area under the curve (AUC) of 95.71% with the top 36 features for the fronto-parietal task control network. In contrast, utilizing all 85 features for the somatosensory motor hand network resulted in an accuracy of 80.38%, sensitivity of 77.77%, specificity of 82.85%, F1-score of 80.27%, and AUC of 80.31%. These findings underscore the model's potential in the precise classification of ASD, offering valuable implications for early diagnosis and intervention.

## 揭开面孔: 用于鲁棒的蒙面和非蒙面面孔识别的混合注意机制

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5364870/latest

Face recognition, an important technology in biometric identification, encounters significant difficulties when facial features are partially occluded, especially by face masks that hide essential facial details. These challenges are addressed by proposing a novel hybrid approach designed to effectively manage both masked and unmasked face recognition. The approach incorporates fixed and adaptive prior attention mechanisms within a deep learning framework to enhance recognition accuracy. The fixed prior attention mechanism uses segmentation to filter out non-informative areas like backgrounds or masks, ensuring that the model concentrates only on the essential facial regions. At the same time, the adaptive prior attention mechanism employs the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to dynamically highlight critical facial features necessary for accurate recognition, while minimizing attention to less relevant areas. This innovative approach is integrated with a customized ResNet architecture which enables the model to produce robust face embeddings crucial for accurate classification. Evaluations on benchmark datasets, including both masked and unmasked scenarios, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.Additionally, an ablation study proves the contribution of each component within the system, showing valuable insights into their specific roles and effectiveness. The findings suggest that the proposed method has significant potential to enhance the reliability and accuracy of face recognition systems in real-world applications.

Social behavior is crucial for survival in many animal species, and a heavily investigated research subject. Current analysis methods generally rely on measuring animal interaction time or annotating predefined behaviors. However, these approaches are time consuming, human biased, and can fail to capture subtle behaviors.
Here we introduce LISBET (LISBET Is a Social BEhavior Transformer), a machine learning model for detecting and segmenting social interactions. Using self-supervised learning on body tracking data, our model eliminates the need for extensive human annotation.
We tested LISBET in three scenarios across multiple datasets in mice: supervised behavior classification, unsupervised motifs segmentation, and unsupervised animal phenotyping. Additionally, in vivo electrophysiology revealed distinct neural signatures in the Ventral Tegmental Area corresponding to motifs identified by our model. In summary, LISBET automates data annotation and reduces human bias in social behavior research, offering a promising approach to enhance our understanding of behavior and its neural correlates.

# Contrastive Distillation Learning with Sparse Spatial Aggregation

## 基于稀疏空间聚合的对比蒸馏学习

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5364334/latest

Contrastive learning has advanced significantly and demonstrates excellent transfer learning capabilities. Knowledge distillation is one of the most effective methods of model compression for computer vision. When combined with contrastive learning, it can achieve even better results. Current knowledge distillation techniques based on contrastive learning struggle to efficiently utilize the information from both student and teacher models, often missing out on optimizing the contrastive framework. This results in a less effective knowledge transfer process, limiting the potential improvements in model performance and representation quality. To address this limitation, we propose a new contrastive distillation learning method by redesigning the contrastive learning framework and incorporating sparse spatial aggregation. This method introduces a novel integration of feature alignment and spatial aggregation mechanism to enhance the learning process. It ensures that the representations obtained by the model fully capture the semantics of the original input. Compared to traditional unsupervised learning methods, our approach demonstrates superior performance in both pre-training and transfer learning. It achieves 71.6 Acc@1, 57.6 AP, 75.8 mIoU, 39.8/34.8 AP on ImageNet linear classification, Pascal VOC object detection, Cityscapes semantic segmentation, MS-COCO object detection and instance segmentation. Moreover, our method exhibits stable training and does not require large pre-training batch-sizes or numerous epochs.

# Local Corner Smoothing Based on Deep Learning for CNC Machine Tools

## 基于深度学习的数控机床局部角点平滑

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5229215/latest

Most of toolpaths for machining is composed of series of short linear segments (G01 command), which limits the feedrate and machining quality. To generate a smooth machining path, a new optimization strategy is proposed to optimize the toolpath at the curvature level. First, the three essential components of optimization are introduced, and the local corner smoothness is converted into an optimization problem. The optimization challenge is then resolved by an intelligent optimization algorithm. Considering the influence of population size and computational resources on intelligent optimization algorithms, a deep learning algorithm, the Double-ResNet Local Smoothing (DRLS) algorithm, is proposed to further improve optimization efficiency. The First-Double-Local Smoothing (FDLS) algorithm is used to optimize the positions of NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline) control points, and the Second-Double-Local Smoothing (SDLS) algorithm is employed to optimize the NURBS weights to generate a smoother toolpath, thus allowing the cutting tool to pass through each local corner at a higher feedrate during the machining process. In order to ensure machining quality, geometric constraints, drive condition constraints, and contour error constraints are taken into account during the feedrate planning process. Finally, three simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

# Deep Rank to Match Model via Multi-task Learning for Online Large-scale Recommender System

## 基于多任务学习的在线大规模推荐系统深度秩匹配模型

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5361651/latest

Large-scale recommender systems consist of two stages: matching and ranking. The matching stage retrieves candidate items relevant to user interests, while the ranking stage predicts the probabilities of user interactions with these items. Traditional matching models retrieve items with high relevance but not necessarily good business indicators like CTR. Integrating the ranking task into the matching stage using multi-task learning (MTL) addresses this issue. Challenges include dealing with the inconsistency of sample space and training objectives between matching and ranking, and building an MTL framework that meets computational cost requirements. We propose the Deep Rank to Match via Multi-Task Learning (DRMMTL) model to tackle these challenges. DRMMTL introduces the ranking task into the matching stage and uses a dual-tower structure to ensure computational efficiency and consistency of final scores. Offline evaluation on real-world datasets and online A/B tests validate DRMMTL's superiority, showing significant performance improvements over traditional matching models. DRMMTL has been successfully deployed on our e-commerce recommendation platform, handling major online traffic.

# Evidential Deep Learning for Guided Drug-Target Interaction Prediction

## 证据深度学习指导药物-靶标相互作用预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5374284/latest

Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is a crucial component of drug discovery. Recent deep learning methods show great potential in this field but also encounter substantial challenges. These include generating reliable confidence estimates for predictions, enhancing robustness when handling novel, unseen DTIs, and mitigating the tendency toward overconfident and incorrect predictions. To solve these problems, we propose EviDTI, a novel approach utilizing evidential deep learning (EDL) for uncertainty quantification in neural network-based DTI prediction. EviDTI integrates multiple data dimensions, including drug 2D topological graphs and 3D spatial structures, and target sequence features. Through EDL, EviDTI provides uncertainty estimates for its predictions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrated the competitiveness of EviDTI against five state-of-the-art baseline models. In addition, our study shows that EviDTI can calibrate prediction errors. More importantly, well-calibrated uncertainty information enhanced the efficiency of drug discovery by prioritizing DTIs with higher confident predictions for experimental validation. In a case study focused on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), uncertainty-guided predictions identified novel potential inhibitors targeting FAK and FLT3. These results underscore the potential of evidential deep learning as a robust tool for uncertainty quantification in DTI prediction and its broader implications for accelerating drug discovery.

# Departing Classroom Constraints: Learners&rsquo; Shift to VR for Language Self-study Amidst Methodology, Atmosphere, and Time Challenges

## 离开课堂限制: 在方法论，氛围和时间挑战中，学习者转向VR进行语言自学

Language education is undergoing significant transformation driven by psychological factors and technological advancements. Traditional learning environments present various challenges, including methodological limitations, psychological barriers related to learning atmosphere, and time-management constraints. This study investigated the interrelationship between these challenges (termed the M.A.T. framework) and learners&rsquo; tendencies toward self-study approaches, while exploring Virtual Reality (VR) technology as a potential solution in addressing these multifaceted learning barriers. Through a targeted survey of 106 self-study language learners&mdash;a specialized population characterized by their autonomous learning approach and typically difficult to access&mdash; I examined both the drivers of self-study choices and attitudes toward VR adoption.
For the research methodology, I employed both quantitative analysis and psychological assessment to understand learners&rsquo; motivations and technological acceptance. Logistic regression analysis revealed that learners facing time-management (OR: 5.46, 95% CI: 1.65-18.09) and psychological atmosphere-related challenges (OR: 4.66, 95% CI: 1.18-18.40) were significantly more likely to consider VR solutions compared to those experiencing methodological challenges. Notably, 72% of participants showed willingness to try VR language learning, while methodology-related challenges demonstrated lower relevance than initially hypothesized.
In this study I combined quantitative survey techniques with psychological insights, contributing to our understanding of how technological solutions might address traditional learning environment challenges leading to educational change. These findings have significant implications for educational technology development, learning environment design, and the future implementation of VR in language education. Furthermore, the results suggest a shifting paradigm in language learning methodology, where technological solutions could effectively address psychological and time-management barriers in educational settings.

# Data reconstruction from machine learning models via inverse estimation and Bayesian inference

## 通过逆估计和贝叶斯推理从机器学习模型中重建数据

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5220310/latest

This study explores the task of data reconstruction from machine learning models via inverse estimation and Bayesian inference, with the goal of recovering the original dataset solely based on the trained model. We introduce a novel theoretical framework that investigates the factors affecting the data reconstruction quality. Specifically, we derive expressions that quantify how variations in key variables influence the divergence between true and estimated posteriors by examining the concurrent behavior of their partial derivatives with respect to independent variables. This derivative-based approach establishes theoretical correlations between the variables, demonstrating that the fidelity of the recovered data is governed by two primary factors: (1) the accuracy of the assumed prior, and (2) the accuracy of the machine learning model. Empirical results across multiple benchmark datasets and machine learning algorithms corroborate these theoretical predictions, reinforcing the validity and robustness of our theoretical framework. Practically, our data reconstruction method enables the creation of synthetic models that closely replicate the performance of the original models. This work contributes to advancing the theoretical understanding and practical techniques for data reconstruction and model introspection within the context of machine learning.
