## 用于机器学习潜力的分子量子化学数据集和数据库

Link: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ad8f13

The field of computational chemistry is increasingly leveraging machine learning (ML) potentials to predict molecular properties with high accuracy and efficiency, providing a viable alternative to traditional quantum mechanical (QM) methods, which are often computationally intensive. Central to the success of ML models is the quality and comprehensiveness of the data sets on which they are trained. Quantum chemistry data sets and databases, comprising extensive information on molecular structures, energies, forces, and other properties derived from QM calculations, are crucial for developing robust and generalizable ML potentials. In this review, we provide an overview of the current landscape of quantum chemical data sets and databases. We examine key characteristics and functionalities of prominent resources, including the types of information they store, the level of electronic structure theory employed, the diversity of chemical space covered, and the methodologies used for data creation. Additionally, an updatable resource is provided to track new data sets and databases at https://github.com/Arif-PhyChem/datasets_and_databases_4_MLPs. This resource also has the overview in a machine-readable database format with the Jupyter notebook example for analysis. Looking forward, we discuss the challenges associated with the rapid growth of quantum chemical data sets and databases, emphasizing the need for updatable and accessible resources to ensure the long-term utility of them. We also address the importance of data format standardization and the ongoing efforts to align with the FAIR principles to enhance data interoperability and reusability. Drawing inspiration from established materials databases, we advocate for the development of user-friendly and sustainable platforms for these data sets and databases.

# Effects of Four-Phonon Scattering and Wave-like Phonon Tunneling Effects on Thermoelectric Properties of Mg2GeSe4 using Machine Learning

## 基于机器学习的四声子散射和类声子隧穿效应对Mg2GeSe4热电性能的影响

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10605

arXiv:2411.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) framework, which substantially accelerates the prediction of lattice thermal conductivity for both particle-like and wave-like thermal transport, including three-phonon and four-phonon scattering processes, and achieves speedups of five orders of magnitude compared to the conventional DFT calculations. We illustrate our approach through an in-depth study of Mg2GeSe4 as an exemplar thermoelectric material. Four phonon scattering is found to reduce lattice thermal conductivity by 22.5% at 300K and 26.7% at 900 K. The particle-like contribution to lattice thermal conductivity decreases, while the wave-like component increases with increasing temperature. The maximum figure of merit zT at 900K is found to be 0.49 for the n-type and 0.45 for the p-type Mg2GeSe4, respectively. Our analysis reveals that a substantial contribution to the Seebeck coefficient is driven by multi-band features in the valence band. Our study gives insight into the promising thermoelectric performance of Mg2GeSe4 and provides an efficient and accurate scheme for developing rational materials discovery strategies and practical applications of thermoelectric materials.

arXiv:2411.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\text{Cu}_7\text{P}\text{S}_6$ compound has garnered significant attention due to its potential in thermoelectric applications. In this study, we introduce a neuroevolution potential (NEP), trained on a dataset generated from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, using the moment tensor potential (MTP) as a reference. The low root mean square errors (RMSEs) for total energy and atomic forces demonstrate the high accuracy and transferability of both the MTP and NEP. We further calculate the phonon density of states (DOS) and radial distribution function (RDF) using both machine learning potentials, comparing the results to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the MTP potential offers slightly higher accuracy, the NEP achieves a remarkable 41-fold increase in computational speed. These findings provide detailed microscopic insights into the dynamics and rapid Cu-ion diffusion, paving the way for future studies on Cu-based solid electrolytes and their applications in energy devices.

# Quantitative evaluation of nuclear quantum effects on the phase transitions in BaTiO3 using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on machine learning potentials

## 基于机器学习势的大规模分子动力学模拟定量评估核量子对BaTiO3相变的影响

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10973

arXiv:2411.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The machine learning potential (MLP) based molecular dynamics (MD) method was applied for constructing the pressure-temperature phase diagram in the barium titanate (BaTiO3) crystals. The nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) on the phase transitions were quantitatively evaluated from the difference in the phase transition pressures between the NQEs-incorporated and classical simulations. In this study, the quantum thermal bath (QTB) method was used for incorporating the NQEs. The constructed phase diagrams verified that the NQEs lower the phase transition temperatures and pressures. The NQEs are more significant at lower temperatures but cannot be ignored even at room temperature. The phase diagram in the QTB-based MLPMD is in good agreement with those of the previous studies based on dielectric measurements and path-integral based simulations. In addition, this study clarified that the large cell size (a 16x16x16 or larger cell) and friction coefficient (>= 15 THz) are required for accurately reproducing the phase transitions during the QTB-MD simulations.

# Absorbing state dynamics of stochastic gradient descent

## 随机梯度下降的吸收状态动力学

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11834

arXiv:2411.11834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a fundamental tool for training deep neural networks across a variety of tasks. In self-supervised learning, different input categories map to distinct manifolds in the embedded neural state space. Accurate classification is achieved by separating these manifolds during learning, akin to a packing problem. We investigate the dynamics of "neural manifold packing" by employing a minimal model in which SGD is applied to spherical particles in physical space. In this model, SGD minimizes the system's energy (classification loss) by stochastically reducing overlaps between particles (manifolds). We observe that this process undergoes an absorbing phase transition, prompting us to use the framework of biased random organization (BRO), a nonequilibrium absorbing state model, to describe SGD behavior. We show that BRO dynamics can be approximated by those of particles with linear repulsive interactions under multiplicative anisotropic noise. Thus, for a linear repulsive potential and small kick sizes (learning rates), BRO and SGD become equivalent, converging to the same critical packing fraction $\phi_c \approx 0.64$, despite the fundamentally different origins of their noise. This equivalence is further supported by the observation that, like BRO, near the critical point, SGD exhibits behavior consistent with the Manna universality class. Above the critical point, SGD exhibits a bias towards flatter minima of the energy landscape, reinforcing the analogy with loss minimization in neural networks.

arXiv:2411.10483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) represents a significant advancement in integrating machine learning (ML) with scientific methodologies. At the forefront of this development are Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which offer a promising approach by incorporating physical laws directly into the learning process, thereby reducing the need for extensive datasets. However, when data is limited or the system becomes more complex, PINNs can face challenges, such as instability and difficulty in accurately fitting the training data. In this article, we explore the capabilities and limitations of the DeepXDE framework, a tool specifically designed for implementing PINNs, in addressing both forward and inverse problems related to dielectric properties. Using RC circuit models to represent dielectric materials in HVDC systems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs in analyzing and improving system performance. Additionally, we show that applying a logarithmic transformation to the current (ln(I)) significantly enhances the stability and accuracy of PINN predictions, especially in challenging scenarios with sparse data or complex models. In inverse mode, however, we faced challenges in estimating key system parameters, such as resistance and capacitance, in more complex scenarios with longer time domains. This highlights the potential for future work in improving PINNs through transformations or other methods to enhance performance in inverse problems. This article provides pedagogical insights for those looking to use PINNs in both forward and inverse modes, particularly within the DeepXDE framework.

# A Data-Efficient Sequential Learning Framework for Melt Pool Defect Classification in Laser Powder Bed Fusion

## 一种数据高效的顺序学习框架，用于激光粉末床融合中的熔池缺陷分类

arXiv:2411.10822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the quality and reliability of Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) components is crucial, especially in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) process, where melt pool defects such as keyhole, balling, and lack of fusion can significantly compromise structural integrity. This study presents SL-RF+ (Sequentially Learned Random Forest with Enhanced Sampling), a novel Sequential Learning (SL) framework for melt pool defect classification designed to maximize data efficiency and model accuracy in data-scarce environments. SL-RF+ utilizes RF classifier combined with Least Confidence Sampling (LCS) and Sobol sequence-based synthetic sampling to iteratively select the most informative samples to learn from, thereby refining the model's decision boundaries with minimal labeled data. Results show that SL-RF+ outperformed traditional machine learning models across key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, demonstrating significant robustness in identifying melt pool defects with limited data. This framework efficiently captures complex defect patterns by focusing on high-uncertainty regions in the process parameter space, ultimately achieving superior classification performance without the need for extensive labeled datasets. While this study utilizes pre-existing experimental data, SL-RF+ shows strong potential for real-world applications in pure sequential learning settings, where data is acquired and labeled incrementally, mitigating the high costs and time constraints of sample acquisition.

# Accelerating Quantum Emitter Characterization with Latent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations

## 用潜在神经常微分方程加速量子发射体表征

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11191

arXiv:2411.11191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network models can be used to learn complex dynamics from data and reconstruct sparse or noisy signals, thereby accelerating and augmenting experimental measurements. Evaluating the quantum optical properties of solid-state single-photon emitters is a time-consuming task that typically requires interferometric photon correlation experiments, such as Photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy (PCFS) which measures time-resolved single emitter lineshapes. Here, we demonstrate a latent neural ordinary differential equation model that can forecast a complete and noise-free PCFS experiment from a small subset of noisy correlation functions. By encoding measured photon correlations into an initial value problem, the NODE can be propagated to an arbitrary number of interferometer delay times. We demonstrate this with 10 noisy photon correlation functions that are used to extrapolate an entire de-noised interferograms of up to 200 stage positions, enabling up to a 20-fold speedup in experimental acquisition time from $\sim$3 hours to 10 minutes. Our work presents a new approach to greatly accelerate the experimental characterization of novel quantum emitter materials using deep learning.

# Bayesian optimization of atomic structures with prior probabilities from universal interatomic potentials

arXiv:2408.15590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimization of atomic structures plays a pivotal role in understanding and designing materials with desired properties. However, conventional computational methods often struggle with the formidable task of navigating the vast potential energy surface, especially in high-dimensional spaces with numerous local minima. Recent advancements in machine learning-driven surrogate models offer a promising avenue for alleviating this computational burden. In this study, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of universal machine learning potentials with a Bayesian approach using Gaussian processes. By using the machine learning potentials as priors for the Gaussian process, the Gaussian process has to learn only the difference between the machine learning potential and the target energy surface calculated for example by density functional theory. This turns out to improve the speed by which the global optimal structure is identified across diverse systems for a well-behaved machine learning potential. The approach is tested on periodic bulk materials, surface structures, and a cluster.

Abstract: Amorphous solids form an enormous and underutilized class of materials. In order to drive the discovery of new useful amorphous materials further we need to achieve a closer convergence between computational and experimental methods. In this review, we highlight some of the important gaps between computational simulations and experiments, discuss popular state-of-the-art computational techniques such as the Activation Relaxation Technique nouveau (ARTn) and Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC), and introduce more recent advances: machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) and generative machine learning for simulations of amorphous matter, e.g., the Morphological Autoregressive Protocol (MAP). Examples are drawn from the amorphous silicon and silica literature as well as from molecular glasses. Our outlook stresses the need for new computational methods to extend the time- and length- scales accessible through numerical simulations.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are poised to revolutionize current solid-state technology with their extraordinary properties. Yet, the primary challenge remains their scalable production. While there have been significant advancements, much of the scientific progress has depended on the exfoliation of materials, a method that poses severe challenges for large-scale applications. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in materials science, innovative synthesis methodologies are now on the horizon. This study explores the forefront of autonomous materials synthesis using an artificial neural network (ANN) trained by evolutionary methods, focusing on the efficient production of graphene. Our approach demonstrates that a neural network can iteratively and autonomously learn a time-dependent protocol for the efficient growth of graphene, without requiring pretraining on what constitutes an effective recipe. Evaluation criteria are based on the proximity of the Raman signature to that of monolayer graphene: higher scores are granted to outcomes whose spectrum more closely resembles that of an ideal continuous monolayer structure. This feedback mechanism allows for iterative refinement of the ANN's time-dependent synthesis protocols, progressively improving sample quality. Through the advancement and application of AI methodologies, this work makes a substantial contribution to the field of materials engineering, fostering a new era of innovation and efficiency in the synthesis process.

arXiv:2406.14839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weighted ensemble (WE) method stands out as a widely used segment-based sampling technique renowned for its rigorous treatment of kinetics. The WE framework typically involves initially mapping the configuration space onto a low-dimensional collective variable (CV) space and then partitioning it into bins. The efficacy of WE simulations heavily depends on the selection of CVs and binning schemes. The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge. Our hybrid approach combines SPIB-learned CVs to enhance sampling in explored regions with expert-based CVs to guide exploration in regions of interest, synergizing the strengths of both methods. Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.

# Data-efficient and Interpretable Inverse Materials Design using a Disentangled Variational Autoencoder

arXiv:2409.06740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse materials design has proven successful in accelerating novel material discovery. Many inverse materials design methods use unsupervised learning where a latent space is learned to offer a compact description of materials representations. A latent space learned this way is likely to be entangled, in terms of the target property and other properties of the materials. This makes the inverse design process ambiguous. Here, we present a semi-supervised learning approach based on a disentangled variational autoencoder to learn a probabilistic relationship between features, latent variables and target properties. This approach is data efficient because it combines all labelled and unlabelled data in a coherent manner, and it uses expert-informed prior distributions to improve model robustness even with limited labelled data. It is in essence interpretable, as the learnable target property is disentangled out of the other properties of the materials, and an extra layer of interpretability can be provided by a post-hoc analysis of the classification head of the model. We demonstrate this new approach on an experimental high-entropy alloy dataset with chemical compositions as input and single-phase formation as the single target property. High-entropy alloys were chosen as example materials because of the vast chemical space of their possible combinations of compositions and atomic configurations. While single property is used in this work, the disentangled model can be extended to customize for inverse design of materials with multiple target properties.

# Towards 250-m gigabits-per-second underwater wireless optical communication using a low-complexity ANN equalizer

## 使用低复杂度的ANN均衡器实现每秒250千兆位的水下无线光通信

arXiv:2411.10674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breakthroughs of communication distance and data rate have been eagerly anticipated by scientists in the area of underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC), which is seriously limited by the obvious aquatic attenuation in underwater channel. High-power laser source and ultra-sensitive photodetector are straightforward to extend the UWOC distance. However, nonlinear impairments caused by bandwidth-limited high-power transmitter and sensitive receiver severely degrade the data rate of long-distance UWOC. In this paper, we develop a UWOC system using a high-power transmitter by beam combining of 8-channel cascaded laser diodes (LD) and a sensitive receiver by a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM). The combined linear equalizer and low-complexity Artificial Neural Network (ANN) equalizer are used to achieve 1-Gbps data transmission over a 250-m UWOC system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Gbps-level UWOC experimental demonstration in >250-meter underwater transmission that has ever been reported. To lower the complexity of the ANN equalizer, a linear equalizer is applied first in order to prune the input size of the ANN equalizer. The optimal input size of the ANN equalizer is identified as 9. And the ANN architecture consists of two hidden layers, with 10 neurons in the first layer and a single neuron in the second layer. The performance of the proposed ANN-based system is compared with that of systems employing Volterra and linear equalizers. The bit error rate (BER) at data rate of 1 Gbps over a 250-m UWOC is reduced to with the combined linear and ANN equalizer, which is below the hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) limit. In contrast, the linear and Volterra equalizer-based systems achieve data rates of 500 Mbps and 750 Mbps, respectively.

Abstract: A popular poster from Myanmar lists food pairings that should be avoided, sometimes at all costs. Coconut and honey taken together, for example, are believed to cause nausea, while pork and curdled milk will induce diarrhea. Worst of all, according to the poster, many seemingly innocuous combinations that include jelly and coffee, beef and star fruit, or pigeon and pumpkin, are likely to kill the unwary consumer. But why are these innocuous combinations considered dangerous, even fatal? The answer is relevant, not just to food beliefs, but to social beliefs of many kinds. Here we describe the prevalence of food combination superstitions, and an opinion formation model simulating their emergence and fixation. We find that such food norms are influenced, not just by actual risks, but also by strong forces of cultural learning that can drive and lock in arbitrary rules, even in the face of contrary evidence.

Abstract: The Moon is directly exposed to various space radiation types: Solar Wind (ions between 0.5 to 10 keV and lower energy electrons), Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs, ranging from 10 keV to several hundred MeV ions and electrons), Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and Anomalous Cosmic Rays (ACRs, ranging from 1 to 100 MeV particles). Monitoring SEPs and GCRs is critical to assess the lunar radiation environment in preparation for the return of humans to the Moon and to understand related radiation risks. As part of the Turkish Lunar Mission (TLM), a small acceptance particle detector is being developed to measure the albedo electron, proton, and heavy ion fluxes backscattered from the lunar surface. In low lunar orbit, the detector FoV will look at the Moon surface. The IRADCAL detectors consist of several layers, from top to down: a Multi-Layer Insulator (MLI); a thin plastic scintillator (S1) seen by four Silicon Photomultipliers (SIPMs), placed to form a cross on light guide surrounding the scintillator (S1); a 26x26x70 mm3 CsI(Tl) crystal scintillator (S2) and a thin crystal scintillator seen by four SIPMs (S3). The detector is designed to measure contained proton energy spectrum from 400 keV to 150 MeV, electron from 50 keV to 10 MeV and heavy ions (up to the CNO group) with energies up to 20 MeV/n. IRADCAL will provide two dE/dX values from two thin scintillators, Etot or dE/dX from thick scintillator, and dE/E ratios for particle identification. A multi-layer perceptron is being developed by using deep neural network algorithm to estimate the Depth of Interaction (DoI). S1 provides level 1 trigger and hit position, which, combined with DoI point, will help determine if a particle is escaping from the sides and to separate up/down-going particles. The thicker S3 will help identify whether the event is fully contained. It will fit in 2U CubeSat with 2.5 kg and 15 Watts of power required.

Abstract: Existing machine learning models of weather variability are not formulated to enable assessment of their response to varying external boundary conditions such as sea surface temperature and greenhouse gases. Here we present ACE2 (Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2) and its application to reproducing atmospheric variability over the past 80 years on timescales from days to decades. ACE2 is a 450M-parameter autoregressive machine learning emulator, operating with 6-hour temporal resolution, 1{\deg} horizontal resolution and eight vertical layers. It exactly conserves global dry air mass and moisture and can be stepped forward stably for arbitrarily many steps with a throughput of about 1500 simulated years per wall clock day. ACE2 generates emergent phenomena such as tropical cyclones, the Madden Julian Oscillation, and sudden stratospheric warmings. Furthermore, it accurately reproduces the atmospheric response to El Ni\~no variability and global trends of temperature over the past 80 years. However, its sensitivities to separately changing sea surface temperature and carbon dioxide are not entirely realistic.

# Coupled Integral PINN for conservation law

## 守恒律的耦合积分PINN

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11276

arXiv:2411.11276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is an innovative approach to solve a diverse array of partial differential equations (PDEs) leveraging the power of neural networks. This is achieved by minimizing the residual loss associated with the explicit physical information, usually coupled with data derived from initial and boundary conditions. However, a challenge arises in the context of nonlinear conservation laws where derivatives are undefined at shocks, leading to solutions that deviate from the true physical phenomena. To solve this issue, the physical solution must be extracted from the weak formulation of the PDE and is typically further bounded by entropy conditions. Within the numerical framework, finite volume methods (FVM) are employed to address conservation laws. These methods resolve the integral form of conservation laws and delineate the shock characteristics. Inspired by the principles underlying FVM, this paper introduces a novel Coupled Integrated PINN methodology that involves fitting the integral solutions of equations using additional neural networks. This technique not only augments the conventional PINN's capability in modeling shock waves, but also eliminates the need for spatial and temporal discretization. As such, it bypasses the complexities of numerical integration and reconstruction associated with non-convex fluxes. Finally, we show that the proposed new Integrated PINN performs well in conservative law and outperforms the vanilla PINN when tackle the challenging shock problems using examples of Burger's equation, Buckley-Leverett Equation and Euler System.

# Modeling Multivariable High-resolution 3D Urban Microclimate Using Localized Fourier Neural Operator

arXiv:2411.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate urban microclimate analysis with wind velocity and temperature is vital for energy-efficient urban planning, supporting carbon reduction, enhancing public health and comfort, and advancing the low-altitude economy. However, traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations that couple velocity and temperature are computationally expensive. Recent machine learning advancements offer promising alternatives for accelerating urban microclimate simulations. The Fourier neural operator (FNO) has shown efficiency and accuracy in predicting single-variable velocity magnitudes in urban wind fields. Yet, for multivariable high-resolution 3D urban microclimate prediction, FNO faces three key limitations: blurry output quality, high GPU memory demand, and substantial data requirements. To address these issues, we propose a novel localized Fourier neural operator (Local-FNO) model that employs local training, geometry encoding, and patch overlapping. Local-FNO provides accurate predictions for rapidly changing turbulence in urban microclimate over 60 seconds, four times the average turbulence integral time scale, with an average error of 0.35 m/s in velocity and 0.30 {\deg}C in temperature. It also accurately captures turbulent heat flux represented by the velocity-temperature correlation. In a 2 km by 2 km domain, Local-FNO resolves turbulence patterns down to a 10 m resolution. It provides high-resolution predictions with 150 million feature dimensions on a single 32 GB GPU at nearly 50 times the speed of a CFD solver. Compared to FNO, Local-FNO achieves a 23.9% reduction in prediction error and a 47.3% improvement in turbulent fluctuation correlation.

# Data-driven model reconstruction for nonlinear wave dynamics

arXiv:2411.11556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning to predict wave dynamics is a topic of growing interest, but commonly-used deep learning approaches suffer from a lack of interpretability of the trained models. Here we present an interpretable machine learning framework for analyzing the nonlinear evolution dynamics of optical wavepackets in complex wave media. We use sparse regression to reduce microscopic discrete lattice models to simpler effective continuum models which can accurately describe the dynamics of the wavepacket envelope. We apply our approach to valley-Hall domain walls in honeycomb photonic lattices of laser-written waveguides with Kerr-type nonlinearity and different boundary shapes. The reconstructed equations accurately reproduce the linear dispersion and nonlinear effects including self-steepening and self-focusing. This scheme is proven free of the a priori limitations imposed by the underlying hierarchy of scales traditionally employed in asymptotic analytical methods. It represents a powerful interpretable machine learning technique of interest for advancing design capabilities in photonics and framing the complex interaction-driven dynamics in various topological materials.

Abstract: Investigating students' thinking in classroom tasks, particularly in science and engineering, is essential for improving educational practices and advancing student learning. In this context, the notion of Ways of Thinking (WoT) has gained traction in STEM education, offering a framework to explore how students approach and solve interdisciplinary problems. Building on our earlier studies and contributing to ongoing discussions on WoT frameworks, this paper introduces a new WoT framework: Ways of Thinking in Engineering Design based Physics (WoT4EDP). WoT4EDP integrates five key elements: design, science, mathematics, metacognitive reflection, and computational thinking within an undergraduate introductory physics laboratory. This framework offers a novel perspective by emphasizing how these interconnected elements work together to foster deeper learning and holistic problem-solving in Engineering Design based projects. We describe the development of WoT4EDP, situate it within the broader landscape of undergraduate STEM education, and provide detailed characterizations of its components. Additionally, we compare WoT4EDP with two contemporary frameworks: Dalal et al. (2021) and English (2023), to glean insights that enhance its application and promote interdisciplinary thinking. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In the upcoming second part, we will demonstrate the application of the WoT4EDP framework, showcasing how it can be used to analyze student thinking in real-world, ED-based physics projects.

# Analysis of Hardware Synthesis Strategies for Machine Learning in Collider Trigger and Data Acquisition

## 对撞机触发和数据采集中机器学习的硬件综合策略分析

arXiv:2411.11678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To fully exploit the physics potential of current and future high energy particle colliders, machine learning (ML) can be implemented in detector electronics for intelligent data processing and acquisition. The implementation of ML in real-time at colliders requires very low latencies that are unachievable with a software-based approach, requiring optimization and synthesis of ML algorithms for deployment on hardware. An analysis of neural network inference efficiency is presented, focusing on the application of collider trigger algorithms in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Trade-offs are evaluated between two frameworks, the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL) and hls4ml, in terms of resources and latency for different model sizes. Results highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach, offering valuable insights for optimizing real-time neural network deployments at colliders. This work aims to guide researchers and engineers in selecting the most suitable hardware and software configurations for real-time, resource-constrained environments.

# Using LSTM Predictions for RANS Simulations

## 使用LSTM预测进行RANS模拟

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11723

arXiv:2411.11723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study constitutes the second phase of a research endeavor aimed at evaluating the feasibility of employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks as a replacement for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models.
  In the initial phase of this investigation (titled Modeling Turbulent Flows with LSTM Neural Networks, arXiv:2307.13784v1 [physics.flu-dyn] 25 Jul 2023), the application of an LSTM-based recurrent neural network (RNN) as an alternative to traditional RANS models was demonstrated. LSTM models were used to predict shear Reynolds stresses in both developed and developing turbulent channel flows, and these predictions were propagated through RANS simulations to obtain mean flow fields of turbulent flows. A comparative analysis was conducted, juxtaposing the LSTM results from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with outcomes from the $\kappa-\epsilon$ model and data from direct numerical simulations (DNS). These initial findings indicated promising performance of the LSTM approach.
  This second phase delves further into the challenges encountered and presents robust solutions. Additionally, new results are provided, demonstrating the efficacy of the LSTM model in predicting turbulent behavior in perturbed flows. While the overall study serves as a proof-of-concept for the application of LSTM networks in RANS turbulence modeling, this phase offers compelling evidence of its potential in handling more complex flow scenarios.

# KAN/MultKAN with Physics-Informed Spline fitting (KAN-PISF) for ordinary/partial differential equation discovery of nonlinear dynamic systems

## 具有物理信息样条拟合 (KAN-PISF) 的KAN/MultKAN用于非线性动力系统的常/偏微分方程发现

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11801

arXiv:2411.11801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning for scientific discovery is increasingly becoming popular because of its ability to extract and recognize the nonlinear characteristics from the data. The black-box nature of deep learning methods poses difficulties in interpreting the identified model. There is a dire need to interpret the machine learning models to develop a physical understanding of dynamic systems. An interpretable form of neural network called Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) or Multiplicative KAN (MultKAN) offers critical features that help recognize the nonlinearities in the governing ordinary/partial differential equations (ODE/PDE) of various dynamic systems and find their equation structures. In this study, an equation discovery framework is proposed that includes i) sequentially regularized derivatives for denoising (SRDD) algorithm to denoise the measure data to obtain accurate derivatives, ii) KAN to identify the equation structure and suggest relevant nonlinear functions that are used to create a small overcomplete library of functions, and iii) physics-informed spline fitting (PISF) algorithm to filter the excess functions from the library and converge to the correct equation. The framework was tested on the forced Duffing oscillator, Van der Pol oscillator (stiff ODE), Burger's equation, and Bouc-Wen model (coupled ODE). The proposed method converged to the true equation for the first three systems. It provided an approximate model for the Bouc-Wen model that could acceptably capture the hysteresis response. Using KAN maintains low complexity, which helps the user interpret the results throughout the process and avoid the black-box-type nature of machine learning methods.

Abstract: This study presents a method, along with its algorithmic and computational framework implementation, and performance verification for dynamical system identification. The approach incorporates insights from phase space structures, such as attractors and their basins. By understanding these structures, we have improved training and testing strategies for operator learning and system identification. Our method uses time delay and non-linear maps rather than embeddings, enabling the assessment of algorithmic accuracy and expressibility, particularly in systems exhibiting multiple attractors. This method, along with its associated algorithm and computational framework, offers broad applicability across various scientific and engineering domains, providing a useful tool for data-driven characterization of systems with complex nonlinear system dynamics.

arXiv:2411.10911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\text{Cu}_7\text{P}\text{S}_6$ compound has garnered significant attention due to its potential in thermoelectric applications. In this study, we introduce a neuroevolution potential (NEP), trained on a dataset generated from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, using the moment tensor potential (MTP) as a reference. The low root mean square errors (RMSEs) for total energy and atomic forces demonstrate the high accuracy and transferability of both the MTP and NEP. We further calculate the phonon density of states (DOS) and radial distribution function (RDF) using both machine learning potentials, comparing the results to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the MTP potential offers slightly higher accuracy, the NEP achieves a remarkable 41-fold increase in computational speed. These findings provide detailed microscopic insights into the dynamics and rapid Cu-ion diffusion, paving the way for future studies on Cu-based solid electrolytes and their applications in energy devices.

# Integrated Ising Model with global inhibition for decision making

## 具有全局抑制的集成Ising模型用于决策

Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11143

arXiv:2411.11143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans and other organisms make decisions choosing between different options, with the aim to maximize the reward and minimize the cost. The main theoretical framework for modeling the decision-making process has been based on the highly successful drift-diffusion model, which is a simple tool for explaining many aspects of this process. However, new observations challenge this model. Recently, it was found that inhibitory tone increases during high cognitive load and situations of uncertainty, but the origin of this phenomenon is not understood. Motivated by this observation, we extend a recently developed model for decision making while animals move towards targets in real space. We introduce an integrated Ising-type model, that includes global inhibition, and use it to explore its role in decision-making. This model can explain how the brain may utilize inhibition to improve its decision-making accuracy. Compared to experimental results, this model suggests that the regime of the brain's decision-making activity is in proximity to a critical transition line between the ordered and disordered. Within the model, the critical region near the transition line has the advantageous property of enabling a significant decrease in error with a small increase in inhibition and also exhibits unique properties with respect to learning and memory decay.

Abstract: Accurately determining the geographic origin of mineral samples is pivotal for applications in geology, mineralogy, and material science. Leveraging the comprehensive Raman spectral data from the RRUFF database, this study introduces a novel machine learning framework aimed at geolocating mineral specimens at the country level.

Abstract: We introduce the Vector-QM24 (VQM24) dataset which comprehensively covers all possible neutral closed shell small organic and inorganic molecules and their conformers that contain up to five heavy atoms (non-hydrogen) consisting of $p$-block elements C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br. This dataset has been systematically generated by considering all combinatorially possible stoichiometries, and graphs (according to Lewis rules), along with all stable conformers identified by GFN2-xTB. We have used density functional theory ($\omega$B97X-D3/cc-pVDZ) to optimize the geometries of 577k conformational isomers corresponding to 258k constitutional isomers consistent with 5,599 unique stoichiometries. Single point diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC@PBE0(ccECP/cc-pVQZ)) energies are reported for the sub-set of all the energetically lowest conformers (10,793 molecules) with up to 4 heavy atoms. Apart from graphs, geometries, rotational constants, and vibrational normal modes, VQM24 includes internal, atomization, electron-electron repulsion, exchange-correlation, dispersion, vibrational frequency, Gibbs free, enthalpy, ZPV and molecular orbital energies; as well as entropy, and heat capacities. Electronic properties include multipole moments (dipole, quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole), electrostatic potentials at nuclei (aka "alchemical potential"), Mulliken charges, and Kohn-Sham orbitals. Supervised machine learning (ML) models of atomization energies on the energetically lowest conformers for the 258k constitutional isomers indicate a significantly more challenging benchmark than the previously introduced QM9 dataset with none of our models reaching chemical accuracy. VQM24 represents an accurate and unbiased benchmark dataset ideal for assessing the efficiency, accuracy and transferability of quantum ML models of real systems.

Abstract: Analyzing the motion of multiple biological agents, be it cells or individual animals, is pivotal for the understanding of complex collective behaviors. With the advent of advanced microscopy, detailed images of complex tissue formations involving multiple cell types have become more accessible in recent years. However, deciphering the underlying rules that govern cell movements is far from trivial. Here, we present a novel deep learning framework for estimating the underlying equations of motion from observed trajectories, a pivotal step in decoding such complex dynamics. Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model with non-reciprocal forces that mimic the collective dynamics of the cells of slime molds. Our results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the functional forms of two-body interactions -- even when they are nonreciprocal -- thereby precisely replicating both individual and collective behaviors within these systems.

# Thermodynamic Transferability in Coarse-Grained Force Fields using Graph Neural Networks

arXiv:2406.12112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coarse-graining is a molecular modeling technique in which an atomistic system is represented in a simplified fashion that retains the most significant system features that contribute to a target output, while removing the degrees of freedom that are less relevant. This reduction in model complexity allows coarse-grained molecular simulations to reach increased spatial and temporal scales compared to corresponding all-atom models. A core challenge in coarse-graining is to construct a force field that represents the interactions in the new representation in a way that preserves the atomistic-level properties. Many approaches to building coarse-grained force fields have limited transferability between different thermodynamic conditions as a result of averaging over internal fluctuations at a specific thermodynamic state point. Here, we use a graph-convolutional neural network architecture, the Hierarchically Interacting Particle Neural Network with Tensor Sensitivity (HIP-NN-TS), to develop a highly automated training pipeline for coarse grained force fields which allows for studying the transferability of coarse-grained models based on the force-matching approach. We show that this approach not only yields highly accurate force fields, but also that these force fields are more transferable through a variety of thermodynamic conditions. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning techniques such as graph neural networks to improve the construction of transferable coarse-grained force fields.

arXiv:2406.14839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weighted ensemble (WE) method stands out as a widely used segment-based sampling technique renowned for its rigorous treatment of kinetics. The WE framework typically involves initially mapping the configuration space onto a low-dimensional collective variable (CV) space and then partitioning it into bins. The efficacy of WE simulations heavily depends on the selection of CVs and binning schemes. The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge. Our hybrid approach combines SPIB-learned CVs to enhance sampling in explored regions with expert-based CVs to guide exploration in regions of interest, synergizing the strengths of both methods. Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.

# Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes problems: joint flow field reconstruction and parameter learning

arXiv:2406.18464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and solve a Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem that assimilates velocimetry data in order to jointly reconstruct a 3D flow field and learn the unknown N-S parameters, including the boundary position. By hardwiring a generalised N-S problem, and regularising its unknown parameters using Gaussian prior distributions, we learn the most likely parameters in a collapsed search space. The most likely flow field reconstruction is then the N-S solution that corresponds to the learned parameters. We develop the method in the variational setting and use a stabilised Nitsche weak form of the N-S problem that permits the control of all N-S parameters. To regularise the inferred the geometry, we use a viscous signed distance field (vSDF) as an auxiliary variable, which is given as the solution of a viscous Eikonal boundary value problem. We devise an algorithm that solves this inverse problem, and numerically implement it using an adjoint-consistent stabilised cut-cell finite element method. We then use this method to reconstruct magnetic resonance velocimetry (flow-MRI) data of a 3D steady laminar flow through a physical model of an aortic arch for two different Reynolds numbers and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels (low/high). We find that the method can accurately i) reconstruct the low SNR data by filtering out the noise/artefacts and recovering flow features that are obscured by noise, and ii) reproduce the high SNR data without overfitting. Although the framework that we develop applies to 3D steady laminar flows in complex geometries, it readily extends to time-dependent laminar and Reynolds-averaged turbulent flows, as well as non-Newtonian (e.g. viscoelastic) fluids.

Abstract: Optical memristors represent a monumental leap in the fusion of photonics and electronics, heralding a new era of new applications from neuromorphic computing to artificial intelligence. However, current technologies are hindered by complex fabrication, limited endurance, high optical loss or low modulation efficiency. For the first time, we unprecedentedly reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss, high precision, high-efficiency modulation, high stability quasi-continuity and reconfigurability. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical switching. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.

# Intra-operative Optimal Flow Diverter Selection for Intracranial aneurysm treatment

## 颅内动脉瘤术中最佳分流术的选择

arXiv:2411.05284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During intracranial aneurysm (IA) treatment with Diverters (FDs), the device/parent artery diameters ratio may influence the ability of the device to induce aneurysm healing response. Oversized FDs are safer to deploy but may not induce enough hemodynamic resistance to ensure aneurysm occlusion. Methods based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) could allow optimal device selection but are time-consuming and inadequate for intra-operative guidance. To address this limitation, we propose to investigate a method for optimal FD selection using Angiographic Parametric Imaging (API) and machine learning (ML). We selected 128 pre-treatment angiographic sequences of IAs which demonstrated full occlusion at six months follow-up. For each IA, we extracted five API parameters from the aneurysm dome and normalized them to the feeding artery corresponding parameters. We dichotomized the dataset based on the FD/ proximal artery diameter ratio as undersized, if the ratio<1 or if multiple FDs were used and oversized otherwise. Single API parameter and ML analysis were used to determine whether API parameters could be used to determine the need for FD under-sizing (i.e., increased flow resistance). Classification accuracy was assessed using area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC). In total we identified 51 and 77 cases for the undersized and oversized cohorts respectively. Single API parameter analysis yielded an inadequate AUROC ~0.5 while machine learning using all five API parameters yielded and AUROC of 0.72.

arXiv:2405.18458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic neural networks (PNNs) are fast in-propagation and high bandwidth paradigms that aim to popularize reproducible NN acceleration with higher efficiency and lower cost. However, the training of PNN is known to be a challenge, where the device-to-device and system-to-system variations create imperfect knowledge of the PNN. Despite backpropagation (BP)-based training algorithms often being the industry standard for their robustness, generality, and fast gradient convergence for digital training, existing PNN-BP methods rely heavily on the accurate intermediate state extraction for a deep PNN (DPNN). These information accesses truncate the photonic signal propagation, bottlenecking DPNN's operation speed and increasing the system construction cost. Here, we introduce the asymmetrical training (AT) method, tailored for encapsulated DPNNs, where the signal is preserved in the analogue photonic domain for the entire structure. AT's minimum information readout for training bypasses analogue-digital interfaces wherever possible for fast operation and minimum system footprint. AT's error tolerance and generality aim to promote PNN acceleration in a widened operational scenario despite the fabrication variations and imperfect controls. We demonstrated AT for encapsulated DPNN with integrated photonic chips, repeatably enhancing the performance from in-silico BP for different network structures and datasets.

# FuXi Weather: A data-to-forecast machine learning system for global weather

arXiv:2408.05472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weather forecasting traditionally relies on numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems that integrates global observational systems, data assimilation (DA), and forecasting models. Despite steady improvements in forecast accuracy over recent decades, further advances are increasingly constrained by high computational costs, the underutilization of vast observational datasets, and the challenges of obtaining finer resolution. These limitations, alongside the uneven distribution of observational networks, result in global disparities in forecast accuracy, leaving some regions vulnerable to extreme weather. Recent advances in machine learning present a promising alternative, providing more efficient and accurate forecasts using the same initial conditions as NWP. However, current machine learning models still depend on the initial conditions generated by NWP systems, which require extensive computational resources and expertise. Here we introduce FuXi Weather, a machine learning weather forecasting system that assimilates data from multiple satellites. Operating on a 6-hourly DA and forecast cycle, FuXi Weather generates reliable and accurate 10-day global weather forecasts at a spatial resolution of $0.25^\circ$. FuXi Weather is the first system to achieve all-grid, all-surface, all-channel, and all-sky DA and forecasting, extending skillful forecast lead times beyond those of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) high-resolution forecasts (HRES) while using significantly fewer observations. FuXi Weather consistently outperforms ECMWF HRES in observation-sparse regions, such as central Africa, demonstrating its potential to improve forecasts where observational infrastructure is limited.

arXiv:2410.16081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL), a technique most prominently used in natural language and computer vision, has been used to train informative representation spaces for galaxy spectra and images in a self-supervised manner. Following this idea, we implement CL for stars in the Milky Way, for which recent astronomical surveys have produced a huge amount of heterogeneous data. Specifically, we investigate Gaia XP coefficients and RVS spectra. Thus, the methods presented in this work lay the foundation for aggregating the knowledge implicitly contained in the multimodal data to enable downstream tasks like cross-modal generation or fused stellar parameter estimation. We find that CL results in a highly structured representation space that exhibits explicit physical meaning. Using this representation space to perform cross-modal generation and stellar label regression results in excellent performance with high-quality generated samples as well as accurate and precise label predictions.

arXiv:2411.03859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human trajectory modeling is essential for deciphering movement patterns and supporting advanced applications across various domains. However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.

# Unveiling CO2 reactivity with data-driven methods

## 用数据驱动的方法揭示二氧化碳反应性

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-1t4vt?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Carbon dioxide is a versatile C1 building block in organic synthesis.  Understanding its reactivity is crucial for predicting reaction outcomes and identifying suitable substrates for the creation of value-added chemicals and drugs. A recent study [Li et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2020, 142, 8383] estimated the reactivity of CO2 in the form of Mayr's electrophilicity parameter E on the basis of a single carboxylation reaction. The disagreement between experiment (E = –16.3) and computation (E = –11.4) corresponds to a deviation of up to ten orders of magnitude in bimolecular rate constants of carboxylation reactions. Here, we introduce a data-driven approach incorporating supervised learning, quantum chemistry, and uncertainty quantification to resolve this discrepancy. The dataset used for reducing the uncertainty in E(CO2) represents 15 carboxylation reactions in DMSO. However, experimental data is only available for one of these reactions. To ensure reliable predictions, we selected a training set composed of this and 19 additional reactions comprising heteroallenes other than CO2 for which experimental data is available. With the new data-driven protocol, we can narrow down the electrophilicity of carbon dioxide to E = –14.6(5) with 95 % confidence.

Physical molecular models are widely used in educational settings for teaching organic and other branches of chemistry, offering an intuitive understanding of molecular structures. Conversely, while less intuitive, virtual models provide additional functionalities, such as retrieving molecular names and other properties. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, there is a gap between 3D molecular models and their digital counterparts. This paper introduces a computer vision model designed to bridge this gap by converting images of physical molecular models into their digital DeepSMILES representations. This conversion facilitates further information retrieval, enhancing educational utility. We developed synthetic and real datasets to train our model and evaluated its performance across various dataset combinations. Additionally, we attempted to improve the model’s accuracy by multi-image input and beam search. We achieved 62.0% top1 accuracy and 80.3% top-3 accuracy with beam search and multi-image input on our validation set. We also explored the model’s characteristics, such as explainability by saliency maps, and examined its calibration. We also discussed the model’s limitations and directions for future research.

Ring strain energy (RSE) is crucial for understanding molecular reactivity. However, quantitatively determining RSE through experiments or quantum mechanics is resource-intensive, limiting its application on a large scale. We developed a physics-based workflow and a data-driven graph neural network (GNN) capable of reliably predicting RSE in minutes or milliseconds, respectively. For each molecule, the workflow first identifies low-energy conformers, then computes the RSE using the AIMNet2 machine learning interatomic potentials. We validated the approach both computationally and experimentally. Compared to the ωB97M-D4/Def2-TZVPP method, the workflow achieved an R² value of 0.997 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.896 kcal/mol. Using this workflow, we distinguished reactive from non-reactive molecules in copper-free click chemistry and ring-opening metathesis polymerization, demonstrating the workflow's generalizability to diverse molecules. Furthermore, we compiled "RSE Atlas," a computational database of 16,905 single-ring molecules, providing a rich resource for examining factors influencing RSE. Employing this dataset, we trained a GNN that predicts RSE in milliseconds using only 2D molecular information. Our methods render RSE a readily computable property for on-the-fly applications in experimental and computational work.

# Active delta-learning for fast construction of interatomic potentials and stable molecular dynamics simulations

## 用于快速构建原子间势和稳定分子动力学模拟的主动delta学习

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-fb02r?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Active learning requires massive time for comprehensive sampling of complex potential energy surfaces (PESs) to achieve desirable accuracy and stability of machine learning (ML) potentials. Here we develop an active delta-learning (ADL) protocol for speeding up active learning and building delta-learning models stable in simulations. Our results show that ADL needs ca. ten times fewer sampled points and iterations to obtain models of the same accuracy as without delta-learning. The crucial advantage of the models built with the delta-learning protocol is their remarkable simulation stability: even models from the initial active learning iterations yield reasonable results. In contrast, the pure ML potentials built without delta-learning often lead to the collapse in simulations, i.e., to unphysical structures.

# Bayesian Molecular Optimization for Accelerating Reverse Intersystem Crossing

## 加速反向系统间交叉的贝叶斯分子优化

Link: https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-vjl0k?rft_dat=source%3Ddrss

Spin conversion in molecular excited states is crucial for the development of next-generation optoelectronic devices. However, optimizing molecular structures for rapid spin conversion has relied on time-consuming experimental trial-and-error, which limits the elucidation of the structure-property relationships. Here, we report a Bayesian molecular optimization approach that accelerates virtual screening for rapid triplet-to-singlet reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). One the molecules identified through this virtual screening exhibits a fast RISC rate constant of 1.3 × 108 s–1 and a high external electroluminescence quantum efficiency of 25.7%, which remains as high as 22.8% even at a practical luminance of 5,000 cd m–2 in organic light-emitting diodes. Post-hoc analysis of the trained machine learning model reveals the impact of molecular structural features on spin conversion, paving the way for informed and precise materials development.

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5360431/latest

Aims This study seeks to understand educators&amp;rsquo; perceptions of pedagogical knowledge and concepts/frameworks, such as constructive alignment (CA), Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs), in relation to student-centred pedagogy and their anatomy teaching practices. The study also investigates perceived gaps at the institutional, departmental, and individual levels concerning anatomy teaching and the pedagogical practices that should be promoted.Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study using a mixed methods approach was used for this purpose. In 2022, face-to-face or online interviews were conducted with 14 anatomy educators and course organisers from Zagreb, Masaryk and P&amp;eacute;cs Universities.Results We found that most educators had not received formal teacher training prior to starting anatomy teaching and were unfamiliar with such pedagogical frameworks as constructive alignment, even though they were familiar with the concept of ILOs. Thematic analysis was applied to open-ended questions and the umbrella theme that emerged was &amp;ldquo;Transforming Anatomy Teaching and Learning in the Glocal Classroom: Navigating the Intersections of Pedagogical Practice, Constructive Alignment, and Student-Centred frameworks&amp;rdquo;. Two themes and 6 subthemes were identified from the data. The study presents recommendations and a novel framework linking student-centred approaches, constructive alignment, and global educational sustainability agendas, such as SDG4.7 to enhance the quality of anatomy teaching.

## 基于可靠性和深度学习的智能电网家域网攻击检测框架

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5385641/latest

The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into our daily lives finds application in various domains, with the Home Area Network (HAN) being a notable facet. Within the realm of IoT applications, the Smart Grid stands out as an intelligent power network characterized by bidirectional flows of electricity and information. This interconnected system utilizes advanced communication infrastructure to efficiently manage the operation of all linked components, ensuring a reliable and sustainable electricity supply. The Home Area Network serves as a dedicated network linking devices within homes, including electrical vehicles. As the HAN market evolves within the smart grid sector, offering diverse solutions for residential needs, it faces challenges associated with the increasing reliance on information technology. The deep integration of electrical components with computing information in cyberspace renders the system susceptible to cyber-attacks, posing concerns for both power system operators and users. These attacks have the potential to compromise the control system of the power grid, leading to disruptions and incidents. This paper introduces a model approach and validates the security of HAN networks. A novel Reliability Oriented Recursive Energy Effective Redirecting Algorithm [ROREERA] is proposed, incorporating a data encryption scheme for secure data transfer within the HAN. The encryption and decryption of data employ the Honey Crock algorithm. To enhance security further, a deep auto-encoder is employed for intrusion detection, safeguarding the HAN against cyber-attacks. The entire experimentation process is conducted within the Mat lab environment.

# Machine learning and data-driven inverse modeling of metabolomics unveil key process of active aging

## 代谢组学的机器学习和数据驱动的逆向建模揭示了主动衰老的关键过程

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5377652/latest

Physical inactivity and weak fitness status have become a global health concern. Metabolomics, as an integrative systematic approach, might link to individual&amp;rsquo;s fitness at the molecular level. In this study, we performed blood samples metabolomics analysis of a cohort of elderly people with different treatments. By defining two groups of fitness and corresponding metabolites profiles, we tested several machine learning classifications to identify key metabolite biomarkers, which showed robustly aspartate as a dominant negative marker of fitness. Following, the metabolomics data of the two groups were analyzed by a novel approach for metabolic network interaction termed COVRECON. Where we identified the enzyme AST as the most important metabolic regulation between the fit and the less fit groups. Routine blood tests in two cohorts validated significant differences in AST and ALT. In summary, we combine machine-learning classification and COVRECON to identify metabolomics biomarkers and causal processes for fitness of elderly people.

# An examination of daily CO2 emissions prediction through a comparative analysis of Machine learning, Deep learning, and Statistical models

## 通过机器学习，深度学习和统计模型的比较分析来检查每日二氧化碳排放量的预测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4648686/latest

Human-induced global warming, primarily attributed to the rise in atmospheric CO2, poses a substantial risk to the survival of humanity. While most research focuses on predicting annual CO2 emissions, which are crucial for setting long-term emission mitigation targets, the precise prediction of daily CO2 emissions is equally vital for setting short-term targets. This study examines the performance of 14 models in predicting daily CO2 emissions data from 1/1/2022 to 30/9/2023 across the top four polluting regions (China, USA, India, and EU27&amp;amp;UK). The 14 models used in the study comprise four statistical models (ARMA, ARIMA, SARMA, and SARIMA), three machine learning models (Support Vector Machine - SVM, Random Forest - RF, and Gradient Boosting - GB), and seven deep learning models (Artificial Neural Network - ANN, Recurrent Neural Network variations such as Gated Recurrent Unit - GRU, Long Short-Term Memory - LSTM, Bidirectional-LSTM - BILSTM, and three hybrid combinations of CNN-RNN). Performance evaluation employs four metrics (R2, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). The results show that machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, with higher R2 (0.714&amp;ndash;0.932) and l ower RMSE (0.480&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;0.247) values, respectively, outperformed the statistical model, which had R2 (-0.060&amp;ndash;0.719) and RMSE (1.695&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;0.537) values, in predicting daily CO2 emissions across all four regions. The performance of ML and DL models was further enhanced by differencing, a technique that improves accuracy by ensuring stationarity and creating additional features and patterns the model can learn from. Additionally, applying ensemble techniques such as bagging and voting improved the performance of ML models by about 9.6%, while hybrid combinations of CNN-RNN enhanced the performance of RNN models. In summary, the performance of both ML and DL models was relatively similar. However, due to the high computational requirements associated with DL models, the recommended models for daily CO2 emission prediction are ML models using the ensemble technique of voting and bagging. This model can assist in accurately forecasting daily emissions, aiding authorities in setting targets for CO2 emissions reduction.

# An adaptive fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery based on GCN deep feature extraction and OptGB

## 基于GCN深度特征提取和OptGB的旋转机械自适应故障诊断方法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5004157/latest

Detecting faults in bearings and gears is pivotal for smooth machinery and equipment operation, as well as in preventing potentially catastrophic accidents. However, the fault diagnosis method using deep learning is highly dependent on the correlation between the extracted vibration signal features, while the original graph convolutional network (GCN) cannot accurately identify the fault type of rotating machinery and is sensitive to the noise. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new fault diagnosis model for rotating machinery based on GCN deep feature extraction and LightGBM optimized by Optuna (GCN-OptGBM). Firstly, in the graph-building stage, the mutual information is used to filter the features and reduce the complexity of the subsequent graph model. Secondly, the weighted &amp;nbsp;Minkowski distance is used to convert the feature matrix into the graph data, then the feature matrix and graph data are input into the GCN together, and the feature extraction is carried out through three graph convolution layers and two rule layers. Finally, the extracted feature data are input into the LightGBM optimized by the Optuna algorithm to achieve the adaptive fault diagnosis and obtain the optimal fault identification results. Experiments are performed on the public dataset of bearings and gears, and the experimental results show that compared with other models, GCN-OptGBM has higher recognition accuracy, better noise immunity and robustness.

# Constraining Genetic Symbolic Regression via Semantic Backpropagation

## 通过语义反向传播约束遗传符号回归

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5042280/latest

Evolutionary symbolic regression approaches are powerful tools that can approximate an explicit mapping between input features and observation for various problems. However, ensuring that explored expressions maintain consistency with domain-specific constraints remains a crucial challenge. While neural networks are able to employ additional information like conservation laws to achieve more appropriate and robust approximations, the potential remains unrealized within genetic algorithms. This disparity is rooted in the inherent discrete randomness of recombining and mutating to generate new mapping expressions, making it challenging to maintain and preserve inferred constraints or restrictions in the course of the exploration. To address this limitation, we propose an approach centered on semantic backpropagation incorporated into the Gene Expression Programming (GEP), which integrates domain-specific properties in a vector representation as corrective feedback during the evolutionary process. By creating backward rules akin to algorithmic differentiation and leveraging pre-computed subsolutions, the mechanism allows the enforcement of any constraint within an expression tree by determining the misalignment and propagating desired changes back. To illustrate the effectiveness of constraining GEP through semantic backpropagation, we take the constraint of physical dimension as an example. This framework is applied to discover physical equations from the Feynman lectures. Results have shown not only an increased likelihood of recovering the original equation but also notable robustness in the presence of noisy data.

# Crosswalk Traffic Light Detection for the Visually Impaired Based on Hybrid Classical-Quantum Neural Networks

## 基于混合经典-量子神经网络的视障人行横道交通灯检测

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5393740/latest

This paper proposes a novel two-step method combining classical and quantum computation to accurately detect crosswalk traffic lights for visually impaired pedestrians. The first step utilizes the improved YOLOv5 model to identify crosswalk traffic light locations. In the second step, the detected lights are processed using a single-layer quantum convolutional neural network with a newly designed parameterized quantum circuit. The proposed quantum circuit reduces the number of qubits and circuit depth required while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our method has better performance compared to existing methods, achieving detection accuracy of 94.9%, precision of 95.4%, and the AUC reaches 0.98. These results also demonstrate the model&amp;rsquo;s robustness in complex traffic environments.

# Are AI weather models learning atmospheric physics? A sensitivity analysis of cyclone Xynthia

## 人工智能天气模型是在学习大气物理学吗？Xynthia气旋的敏感性分析

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5356949/latest

Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather models are explored for initial condition sensitivity studies to analyze the physicality of the relationships learned. Gradients (or sensitivities) of the target metric of interest are computed with respect to the variable fields at initial time by means of the backpropagation algorithm and gradient descent, which do not assume linear perturbation growth. Here, sensitivities from an AI model at 36-hour lead time were compared to those produced by an adjoint of a dynamical model for an extreme weather event, cyclone Xynthia, presenting very similar structures and with the evolved perturbations leading to similar impacts. This demonstrates the ability of the AI model to learn physically-meaningful spatio-temporal links between atmospheric processes. These findings should enable researchers to conduct initial condition studies in minutes, potentially at lead times into the non-linear regime (typically&amp;thinsp;&amp;gt;&amp;thinsp;5 days), with important applications in observing network design and the study of atmospheric dynamics.

# Enhancing Enzyme Activity with Mutation Combinations Guided by Few-shot Learning and Causal Inference

## 通过少镜头学习和因果推断指导的突变组合增强酶活性

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5354708/latest

Designing enzyme sequences to enhance product yield represents a fundamental challenge in metabolic engineering. Here, we established a workflow that integrates computational predictions with efficient experimental iteration to obtain outsized gains in product yield. Based on causal inference and examination of published datasets from previous yield-boosting engineering efforts, we realized and ultimately experimentally confirmed that in vivo unit yield (yield/expression) can serve as an attractive surrogate for aqueous Kcat/KM when optimizing for in vivo enzyme activity. In our workflow, we initially predict activity-enhancing single mutants by calculating the binding affinities of reactive intermediates, followed by experimental investigations of unit yield. Subsequently, we predict activity-enhancing mutation combinations using a few-shot learning model we developed called Physics-Inspired Feature Selection of Protein Language Models (PIFS-PLM), which requires only 60&amp;ndash;100 experimentally examined mutation combinations as input, and which identifies enzyme regions likely to support additional yield gains from mutation based on the &amp;ldquo;local activity landscape&amp;rdquo;. In a case study of a bicyclogermacrene (BCG) synthase, we achieve a 72-fold increase in BCG yield based on combinations of 12 individual mutations, and provide extensive crystallographic and biochemical evidence for impacts from specific mutations. Thus, optimizing for unit yield is highly efficient as an alternative to optimizing for thermostability, and our study provides a powerful workflow for the efficient engineering of high-yield enzyme variants.

# A Novel Hybrid Differential Evolutionary Algorithm for Solving Multi-objective Distributed Permutation Flow-shop Scheduling Problem

## 一种求解多目标分布式置换流水车间调度问题的混合差分进化算法

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5367783/latest

The Distributed Permutation Flow-shop Scheduling Problem (DPFSP) is a classic issue in distributed scheduling that involves job allocation and processing order within a factory, and it is known to be NP-hard. Numerous researchers have proposed various intelligent optimization algorithms to address the DPFSP; however, achieving solutions of sufficient quality to meet production practice requirements remains challenging. To tackle the multi-objective DPFSP, this paper proposes a novel hybrid differential evolutionary algorithm aimed at minimizing both the maximum completion time and delay time. In this algorithm, Bernoulli chaotic mapping is applied during the population initialization process to enhance the diversity of the initial population. Additionally, an adaptive mutation factor and crossover rate are designed to balance the global and local search capabilities of the algorithm. Furthermore, a novel selection strategy is constructed based on the NEH algorithm, specular reflection learning, and Pareto dominance relation to improve the quality of the solution set when solving instances of varying sizes. This strategy enhances the algorithm's optimization ability and helps it escape local optima. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm are verified through 24 instances of different sizes. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other improved algorithms in terms of convergence, and the uniformity and diversity of the solution set, making it an effective solution for the multi-objective distributed permutation flow-shop scheduling problem.

# Generative Image Steganography Based on Point Cloud

## 基于点云的生成式图像隐写

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5388114/latest

In deep steganography, the model size is usually related to the underlying mesh resolution, and a separate neural network needs to be trained as a message extractor. In this paper, we propose a generative image steganography based on point cloud representation, which represents image data as a point cloud, learns the distribution of the point cloud data, and represents it in the form of a continuous function. This method breaks through the limitation of the image resolution, and can generate images with arbitrary resolution according to the actual need, and omits the need for explicit data for image steganography. At the same time, using a fixed point cloud extractor transfers the training of the network to the point cloud data, which saves the training time and avoids the risk of exposing the steganography behavior caused by the transmission of the message extractor. Experiments prove that the steganographic images generated by the scheme have very high image quality and the accuracy of message extraction reaches more than 99%.

This study presents an innovative material classification system designed using an inductive tactile sensor and machine learning algorithms. A simple-structured sensor based on the principle of electromagnetic induction was developed to capture varying inductance signals induced by different materials with distinct magnetic properties, facilitating material detection and distinction. A dataset comprising 10 types of materials was evaluated with the sensor, and three machine learning algorithms, namely the support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, and na&amp;iuml;ve bayes models, were trained using the output data. Subsequent performance evaluation employed several metrics, including mean accuracy, precision, recall, and others, and revealed that the na&amp;iuml;ve bayes model exhibited superior performance in prediction. Finally, an enhanced aggregated classification model was developed, where the soft voting ensemble learning technique was employed with the individual classifiers mentioned above as base models. The study underscores the system&amp;rsquo;s feasibility for potential implementation in high-performance manufacturing and intelligent automation, such as the motorsports and automotive sector, which could facilitate the development of an Industry 4.0 environment. Furthermore, the study also suggests routes for future work that could bolster performance of this system and emphasizes on the necessity for practical implementations to link the system with real-world applications.

# Advanced Knee Point Prediction and Health Monitoring Technique for Improved Electric Vehicle Battery Safety

## 先进的拐点预测和健康监测技术可提高电动汽车电池的安全性

Link: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-5288836/latest

The knee point is a critical threshold indicating a significant change in data behaviour, essential for optimizing predictions in electric vehicles (EVs). Predicting accurate knee points EV batteries is crucial for ensuring battery safety by identifying critical conditions and potential hazards. Leveraging machine learning (ML) algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), AdaBoost, neural networks (NN), and proposed novel hybrid XGBoost-random forest (XG-RF), the research aims to enhance the accuracy of knee point prediction using slope change method from early battery cycles. Assessment involves absolute error metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) to measure the accuracy of knee point model predictions and mean absolute deviations (MAD) for slope change deviations on dynamic state of health (SOH) curve for different battery chemistries (LFP and NMC) at various temperatures (0℃, 25℃, and 35℃). The proposed XG-RF model consistently outperforms with improved accuracy in terms of lower MAE values as 0.15, 0.13 and 0.13 for NMC and 0.11 for LFP respectively for different temperature. The study's anticipated outcomes extend insights into ML model comparison, novel metric validation, and a comprehensive understanding of algorithms impacting knee point prediction, ultimately contributing to improved EV battery safety.
